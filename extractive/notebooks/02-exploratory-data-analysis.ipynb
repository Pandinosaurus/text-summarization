With categories ranging from \"favorite movie\" to \"favorite music fan following,\" your voice needs to heard.\n",
      "Maroon 5 frontman and \"The Voice\" judge Adam Levine leads the list of nominees with six nods in both the music and television categories, while Justin Bieber is the top individual nominee with five music nods. The two artists with will go head-to-head in the favorite album and favorite music video categories, forcing you to choose between the two men with the best head of hair and the highest pitched voice in the industry. Too bad Justin Timberlake isn't in the running.\n",

      "CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: All right, forget Fridays. That was awesome! Thank you guys so much for submitting that! We've got 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines before we hit the yellow brick road, so let's go ahead and get rolling!\n",
      "First Up: Midterm Elections\n",
      "AZUZ: Four days! That's all the time that midterm candidates have left to convince Americans to vote for them. Win or lose in next Tuesday's midterm elections, running for office comes at a price. You've got to produce TV ads, you've got to make signs, pay a staff. All of that adds up. Dana Bash takes us out on the campaign trail to look at the money trail and see how much is being spent and where it's all coming from.\n",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO)\n",
      "DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sure, there's a lot of money flowing in this year's election. But exactly how much being spent is mind blowing: $4 billion dollars. To put $4 billion in context, that's enough to send about 80,000 students to Princeton for a year. It could buy every person in America three Big Macs with fries at McDonald's. Four billion is far more than the $2.85 billion spent in the last midterm election in 2006, and dwarfs the $1.61 billion spent little more than a decade ago in 1998. OpenSecrets.org compiled the figures in a new report.\n",
      "SHEILA KRUMHOLZ, CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS: The stakes are so high this cycle that it's not surprising that there's an intensity to this cycle that was perhaps reduced or missing in the last cycles.\n",
      "BASH: Though much of the four billion is spent by candidates themselves, an eyepopping amount is coming from outside candidates' campaigns; political parties and independent groups. $430 million dollars in overall outside spending. Only $31 million was spent in 2002, less than a decade ago.\n",
      "And despite Democrats' complaints about being outspent, when it comes to political parties, Democrats are winning. All told, the Democratic Party has raised $782 million dollars. A lot more than the Republican Party, at $515 million. But GOP outside groups, with ads like this, are making up for that gap and then some. Although Democratic groups are catching up, they're being outspent by GOP counterparts 2-1.\n",
      "Another fascinating 2010 trend: key industries moving campaign cash from Democrats to Republicans. Take the health care sector. When the president took office, two thirds of its dollars were going to Democrats. Since health care passed, the industry is giving 60% to Republicans. The same goes for money from Wall Street and the energy sector. Just last year, both gave mostly to Democrats. Now, 67% of Wall Street money goes to Republicans. The energy sector: 74% to Republicans.\n",
      "KRUMHOLZ: I think they've got their finger in the air. I think they're looking at the changing poll numbers and seeing that the Republicans have a clear shot at taking the majority, particularly in the House.\n",

      "Indonesia Disasters\n",
      "AZUZ: Following up on some international headlines for you now, beginning in Indonesia. Earlier this week, the nation suffered through an earthquake, a tsunami -- a giant ocean wave caused by the earthquake -- and a volcanic eruption. Officials are trying to get help to the victims of these natural disasters, but that's been tough with all the disasters they've had to deal with. Plus, Indonesia is made up of thousands of islands, and some of those are hard to reach. Here, you can see a plane dropping aid in one of the areas that was affected. Other groups are using boats, but those deliveries can take hours. Some of the most immediate needs: clean water, food, blankets and medical attention.\n",
      "Cholera Outbreak\n",
      "AZUZ: In Haiti, officials are trying to figure out what started an outbreak of cholera. They're testing waste and sewage water for the bacteria that causes the disease. The outbreak, meanwhile, is getting worse. Workers are trying to fight it. One of the problems in that fight is that a lot of people in Haiti are living in tents after January's earthquake. They need medical supplies to survive, but some people can't get them. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is in Haiti trying to find out why.\n",

      "GUPTA: Where patients are literally begging for hydration, clean water, the cheapest of supplies. And yet medical relief worker Julie Santos still waits for hours for her paperwork to be approved before she can get the supplies. I wanted to try and understand myself.\n",
      "Promise warehouse, a World Health Organization facility, has the largest stockpile of supplies here in Haiti. What people have been waiting for, for hours outside and days in hospitals is this: pallets of I.V. fluids; literally, life-saving stuff to treat these patients with cholera, thousands of them. But it's not just that pallet. You take a look at this whole warehouse, full, despite what's happening here in Haiti.\n",

      "TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the Facts! The Great Depression was the longest and worst economic crisis in U.S. history. It started in 1929 and lasted around a decade. During this period, unemployment climbed to more than 25%, thousands of American banks failed, and U.S. industrial production was cut almost in half. The Depression was felt around the world and led to significant changes in economic theories and policies.\n",
      "This Day in History\n",
      "AZUZ: A major event that helped plunge the U.S. into the Great Depression happened on this very day in history: October 29th, 1929. Or as a lot of people know it, Black Tuesday. Wall Street, the stock market crashed, and hard. More than 16 million shares of stock were traded. Stock tickers, the machines that people used to read stock prices, couldn't keep up with all the trading. They fell hours behind. Billions of dollars were lost on Black Tuesday, and thousands of investors were completely wiped out.\n",

      "JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Gardner's U.S. studies classes at Indian Valley High School in Gnadenhutten, Ohio! The word \"tuition\" can be traced back to what language? Is it: A) Greek, B) Roman, C) Latin or D) Aramaic? You've got three seconds -- GO! Tuition, what you pay for instruction, comes from Latin. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!\n",
      "Cost of College\n",
      "AZUZ: The word \"increase\" comes from latin, too. And that is what tuition is doing right now; it's going up. Probably not a big surprise. The cost of college has been increasing for years. What's interesting is that tuition at public schools is going up faster than it is at private schools. A lot of that has to do with states struggling financially. The higher tuition costs help make up for money that schools aren't getting from their states. Look at the numbers here. In-state tuition at a four-year public school is around $7,600 per year. That's up nearly 8 percent from last year. At a four-year private school, tuition is a little more than $27,000 per year. That's up 4.5 percent from last year.\n",

      "He says he's battled depression and loves to do drama as much as the funny stuff.\n",
      "Fans of his lighter side, though, may be glad to see his latest film is a comedy, \"Yes Man,\" which opens in theaters Friday.\n",
      "Carrey spoke with CNN's Larry King about his life on and off the screen.\n",
      "King: How did you get this project?\n",
      "Carrey: I think projects find me. You know, it's really interesting. Everything I've done, from \"The Truman Show,\" the \"Eternal Sunshine\" to \"Yes Man\" and \"Bruce Almighty,\" always come into my life at the perfect time.\n",
      "King: So have you turned down anything you regretted?\n",
      "Carrey: I never regret. ... [But] you know, \"Meet the Parents\" was something that I was developing.\n",
      "King: You turned that down?\n",
      "Carrey: Yes. I actually created the Fockers in a creative meeting. Yes. But, it was perfect that Ben Stiller did it. When I saw it, I went, \"That's the way it's supposed to be done.\"\n",
      "King: The premise of \"Yes Man\" is what?\n",
      "Carrey: It's a gentleman by the name of Carl Allen, who has kind of stopped living. He got hurt in a relationship and he just kind of went into his shell, and he decided to say no to life. And he decides that, at a certain point, that he's kind of losing touch with everything. He runs into a guru -- a new-age master played by Terrence Stamp. ...  And he makes a covenant with this man that he will say yes to everything no matter how ridiculous it is.\n",
      "King: Isn't \"no\" the hardest word to say?\n",
      "Carrey: It is hard for me. Especially when you've got money. It's like, you know, there's so many people, man.  Watch Carrey's interview with Larry King »\n",
      "King: Are you the most comfortable with comedy?\n",
      "Carrey: No, I love it all, honestly. I love -- I love being creative. ... I feel so lucky to be given all of these opportunities, to be able to do a movie like \"Ace Ventura\" and then do \"The Truman Show\" and \"Eternal Sunshine,\" and to be able to do the \"Yes Man,\" which is flat-out comedy and that has a little something to think about.\n",
      "King: Ever want to do Broadway?\n",
      "Carrey: Sure, sure. I'll do that.\n",
      "King: Do a play?\n",
      "Carrey: I would love to do it. I hope I could do it.\n",
      "King: How did you and [girlfriend Jenny McCarthy] -- how did that happen?\n",
      "Carrey: It's funny how that happens when you're in a place that's really wonderful. I had already gotten to a place in my life where I felt at peace, and I was invited to David Spade's birthday party. And I went out there that night and I was just in a zone. And I just felt wonderful. It was one of those times when you don't have to be anywhere but where you are.\n",
      "King: And you had no girlfriend?\n",
      "Carrey: I had no girlfriend at the time. I mean, I was just knocking them off one after another. It was just sick. But -- so I went to the party. And I just stood there in the middle of the room and kind of had that feeling like I was everything I felt. And she looked at me, and she said, \"You just looked so peaceful that I had to come and talk to you.\"\n",
      "King: What did you think when you saw her?\n",
      "Carrey: I went -- well, I mean, I'd seen her a bunch of times, never in person. But I just thought -- well, she's nothing like the persona, like the \"Singled Out\" person that I met -- or that I knew, that I had seen. Because I don't think I wanted to go out with that person. You know? She was brilliant, but that wasn't the choice I would make. She was completely different than that. She was really sweet.\n",
      "King: And that's magic when it hits?\n",
      "Carrey: Yes. Beautiful.\n",
      "King: You can't predict it?\n",
      "Carrey: No. You're just lucky while it's there, you know. That's all, just lucky.\n",
      "King: Are you going to marry Jenny?\n",
      "Carrey: No. I am married to Jenny. I love Jenny very much, and we have a great relationship. And we've both been married a couple times. ... I like it the way it is, and I think she likes it the way it is. You know? And that's all we need. I really don't, at this point of my life, feel like I need to have the approval of someone in the collar or a judge to tell us that our relationship is sacred.\n",
      "King: Didn't you suffer from depression?\n",
      "Carrey: Yes.\n",
      "King: How did you get through that to this?\n",
      "Carrey: Well, that's another thing. You know at the risk of like opening up the whole Tom Cruise Prozac argument, you know, I don't disagree in many ways. I think Prozac and things like that are very valuable to people for short periods of time. But I believe if you're on them for an extended period of time, you never get to the problem. You never get to see what the problem is, because everything is just kind of OK. And so, you don't deal. And people deal when they get desperate.\n",
      "King: So how did you do it?\n",
      "Carrey: I take supplements. ... It's a wonderful thing. It's amazing. I'm going to talk a lot about it in the near future.\n",

      "Arsenio Hall made history in the early '90s as the first national African-American late night TV talk show host.\n",
      "Aimed at a hip, young demographic, \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" was famous for its trademark \"woof woof\" audience chant and never-know-who-might-stop-by guest list. The show ran from 1989 to 1994 and boasted memorable moments, some of which have become a part of pop culture lore: Bill Clinton playing the saxophone during the '92 campaign; Magic Johnson's first interview after being diagnosed with HIV; and Hall's tense show the night the Los Angeles riots broke out.\n",
      "On Monday, nearly 20 years after his original run, the 57-year-old entertainer heads back to TV with a new show, \"Arsenio.\" Where has he been? How will he carve out his own niche in a very crowed late night field that includes Leno, Fallon, Letterman, Kimmel and Stewart? To paraphrase a certain someone, \"These are the things that make us go 'hmm.'\"\n",
      "CNN caught up with Hall at Hollywood's Sunset Bronson Studios on the set of the new show and got the inside scoop on his big return.\n",
      "CNN: What have you been up to since we last saw you on late-night TV?\n",
      "Arsenio Hall: I have been working hard in just a different element of life, trying to balance my own and do some things that are beyond show business and beyond rooms and (studio) lots like this.\n",
      "I left this business for something I didn't even know I was seeking. I just knew it wasn't in my schedule from sun up to sun down in Hollywood. I left the show for probably balancing my life -- I wanted my relationships to be different. I wanted to be with my family and my woman. It was a point where I felt I don't want to leave this earth without a kid. There were a lot of things going on...\n",
      "I want to do all those things that I wish my dad could have done with me. My mom and my dad worked very hard when I was young; I was a latch-key kid. I not only wanted to have a kid; I wanted to do it a certain way.\n",
      "Once more, with feeling: Where are the women in late-night TV?\n",
      "CNN: How will your new show be different from your late-night competitors?\n",
      "Hall: The good thing about the second time around, there are people who know me, and those 35-year-olds can tell their children, but I'm about to jump back into the culture and I'm the same Arsenio and I just give a different persona to a late-night talk show.\n",
      "Some will love it, some will hate it. But you look for people to choose you because of the questions you ask, because of the bookings you have, because of the comedy you do ... You're choosing what you want people to do with your public figures, your celebrities, your pop and hop stars. And everybody kind of knows what I do and how I do it, and I hope some people will join me for some nights.\n",
      "CNN: Who's on your wish list for guests?\n",
      "Hall: First of all, it's been very complicated booking the first show because I had to decide what I wanted it to be. On that show, I just want a fun return, a party. I just want laughter. No clips, no agendas, just friends and fun.\n",
      "And then the second night on, I'll start to decide whether I need to talk to Chris Brown and whether I can have that kind of interview. One of my dream guests, one of my dream shows, I don't have to do this, it's been done. When I was home, it was these kinds of things that drove me crazy and made me tell my son, is it time for daddy to go back to work yet, every week?\n",
      "I was watching Letterman, and he took his whole show on the roof of the Ed Sullivan Theater with Eminem and Jay-Z. Is that a show? Lord have mercy, that's the kind of TV I like.\n",
      "CNN: Will President Obama be stopping by?\n",
      "Hall: I don't want to be arrogant, so I'll give you the right answer. I will invite him, but he's done a lot in late night. I gotta get real creative to figure out what to do. He's slow-jammed the news, his wife's done the 'Dougie.' Maybe I'll go back to basics, maybe I just do a straight interview. But the bottom line, yeah, he'll be invited.\n",
      "CNN: Any other dream guests?\n",
      "Hall: I called (Bill Clinton) and I said, don't get nervous, I'm not asking a favor from you. But would your wife come out with a saxophone? That would be a move. If I walk out and then say, ooh one minute, grab a hand, and it's Hillary with a saxophone, it's on. Because that's also a special statement if she don't say nothing ... You know Hillary ain't gonna walk out with no saxophone. She might, but I said Bill Clinton wouldn't put on my sunglasses and play an Elvis tune and wear my tie and bring his wife and let her join him, and he said yes to all of that. So sometimes I've learned, ask.\n",
      "CNN: On your old show, you weren't afraid to tear up the script and get serious when the news of the day was serious -- for instance, the night the 1992 L.A. riots broke out. Will that be the case on the new show?\n",
      "Hall: I'm a stand-up comic doing a late-night talk show. But what I like to do in moments like that is bring in a person like Stevie Wonder as the musical guest, and you let Stevie do a number, but you know when we put Stevie on the couch, he'll give us a respectable response to that kind of situation ... I'm sure people, they want to be put to bed with a smile, but they also want me to touch on things that are going on. I'm not bright enough to handle it but there are plenty of guests who can.\n",
      "CNN: You've been off the air for nearly 20 years. How do you introduce yourself to a young audience that's never seen the original show?\n",
      "Hall: After I knew I was coming back and Tribune and CBS syndication had said yes it's a go, I immediately started going on everything. I even wrote an article for Newsweek on fatherhood.\n",
      "I went on Tosh, I went on Chelsea (Handler), I went on Leno about 47 times, I went on Bill Maher's HBO show and did a segment on the 20th anniversary of the riots by the way. I tried to get my face out there and doing everything. When (Access Hollywood host) Billy Bush would take a vacation, I would call (Access Hollywood host) Kit Hoover and say y'all mind if I sit in for Billy? And I'll call Billy and say, if y'all cool with it. I was doing everything I could to get my face out and to show this town that I'm still a viable talking head in late night.\n",
      "CNN: Why come back now?\n",
      "Hall: It starts with your 13-year-old asking you to drop him off about five blocks from the movie theaters or the party he's going to. There's a certain point where you realize you can moonwalk away from fatherhood just a little bit. And I sat down and had a conversation with him. Because part of raising a kid -- to be a man, you have to see a man -- and part of raising a kid is to show him the other side of it too. I love fatherhood. I really love being a dad. But like last night, I fell asleep before he did with the remote in my hand. That's what a young man needs to see too. Hard work, tired.\n",

      "(CNN)  -- The Wu-Tang Clan -- the New York hip-hop supergroup that spawned millions of album sales, nine solo acts and a few acting careers -- almost never was.\n",
      "If RZA, left, had been jailed or Method Man killed, Wu-Tang may have never formed, RZA says.\n",
      "Method Man, the group's most recognizable voice, was nearly killed before the band formed, Wu-Tang's chief producer, RZA, writes in his forthcoming memoir.\n",
      "Meth was walking to buy marijuana at 160 Park Hill Avenue in Staten Island -- the house in Wu-Tang's \"Protect Ya Neck\" video -- when RZA saw him across the street, he writes in the book.\n",
      "\"Come over here, yo!\" RZA beckoned, according to \"The Tao of Wu\" (Riverhead). \"He stopped and came running over. A few seconds later -- pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! -- a guy started shooting up the front of 160. A buddy of ours, Poppy, an innocent, school-going, nice guy -- he was shot and killed right there.\"  Interactive: Where's the Wu been? »\n",
      "It wasn't the only close call RZA said could have snuffed the band that rewrote the rule book for hip-hop acts. The year before the group formed in 1993, RZA was acquitted on an attempted murder charge that could have put him behind bars for eight years, he writes in \"The Tao of Wu,\" out Thursday.\n",
      "Expanding on the book's anecdotes in an interview with CNN, RZA explained that if he had been imprisoned or if Method Man, aka Clifford Smith, had been killed, the band never would have come to fruition.\n",
      "RZA, whose real name is Robert Diggs and whose stage name is pronounced \"Rizza,\" also talked about his role in the death of his cousin, Russell Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard or ODB. Two days before his 36th birthday in 2004, ODB died in a New York recording studio from an overdose of cocaine and painkillers.\n",
      "RZA writes in the book that he once witnessed ODB force his own son to watch him do drugs. RZA tried to leave, he writes, but ODB wouldn't let him. Now, RZA told CNN, he wishes he would've been tougher with ODB about his drug problem.\n",
      "Following are excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for language, flow and length:\n",
      "CNN: Could your imprisonment or Method Man's death have derailed Wu-Tang's formation?\n",
      "RZA: Either one of those incidents could definitely have derailed it. Of course, myself being the abbot, the one who came with the idea, if I wouldn't have made it out of that tumultuous time -- it seemed like I wasn't going to make it out of it; there was a lot of odds against me -- but we stood strong, and self-defense made sense to the jury. We beat that ...\n",
      "It was the victory over that incident that made me change my whole direction. In a way, it's double-edged in that incident. One, if I would've lost that, yeah, Wu-Tang wouldn't have happened, but also it's the victory of it that inspired me and gave me the drive also to go and really get serious about Wu-Tang and the things I was dealing with.\n",
      "Same thing with Meth, he always brings it up ... that that day saved his life. He actually said, if it was anybody else calling him, he wouldn't have came.\n",
      "CNN: In the book, you cite lessons from Eastern religions, Christianity, Islam, [Nation of Islam offshoot] Five Percent, numerology, comic books, kung fu, chess. What would you say to someone who says it's difficult to reconcile these dogmas?\n",
      "RZA: Like it says in the Bible, \"In the beginning was the word, and the word became flesh\" -- if we go to the root of the word, we will find that, yeah, everything is similar. Everything is teaching us all the same path.\n",
      "It's just that one religion was good for these people because of their living conditions. In the Quran, they mention paradise being filled with wells, wells of water, and if you're in the desert and you've got a chance to get water and gardens -- as they describe paradise in the holy Quran -- if you're going to get gardens, that's the paradise that fits your situation. ... Everything they're saying relates to the people they're talking to. ...\n",
      "You remove the messenger and take the message.\n",
      "CNN: You say in the book that your penchant for violent lyrics in your younger years \"was a product of my history and environment\" and that it no longer represents you. But you also say you won't repudiate violence. Why not?\n",
      "RZA: One reason I haven't repudiated it is because when it's necessary, it's necessary. [The Bible's] Ecclesiastes tell us there's a time for everything -- a time for war, a time for peace -- so in times for war, there's time for violence.\n",
      "Then in [the Hindu scripture] Bhagavad Gita, it says Arjuna was talking, Arjuna didn't want to commit violent acts against an army that was attacking him. He couldn't find it in his heart to do it. It was people he loved. He didn't want to get into violence, but Krishna had to point out to him, \"Your duty is your duty.\" ...\n",
      "So, to me, violence in the light of justice is still violent, but I don't see it the same. It's because of justice that I don't repudiate violence because justice must be served somehow.\n",
      "CNN: ODB was a product of his environment as well. To what degree were you and other Wu-Tang members responsible for his death?\n",
      "RZA: The guys would say it's more me than them because they say that's my cousin and I was right there. If you let a man that you love or anybody -- man, woman or child that you love -- sit there and destroy themselves in front of you, you're neglecting them ...\n",
      "Everybody let him do what he wanted to do. ... There were times when I took his drugs and threw them down the toilet. When I do that, he would get so pissed off I don't see him for weeks after that. ...\n",
      "So it got to a point, I was like, \"[expletive] it, let him do his drugs\" just to have him around me, just to keep him there. ... But it's still neglect, yo.\n",
      "CNN: You say you ran Wu-Tang like a dictatorship in its first five years. I know you and Raekwon have had creative differences and Ghostface Killah is suing you over royalties. Ever regret the dictatorship approach?\n",
      "RZA: I don't regret it because it got us to the power we are. ...\n",
      "To me, in the beginning, the dictatorship led us to such a strong foundation that even though Wu-Tang seemed to be crumbling, it didn't fall because of the root foundation of one man's idea. But now as it's coming back together -- we're living in the twilight age of it right now -- it's still surviving because of the democracy of it.\n",
      "CNN: Wu-Tang is still around, but nothing like the heyday of the 1990s. Will we ever see a renaissance?\n",
      "RZA: Well, to me, Wu-Tang is beyond Wu-Tang Clan. ... It's just like hip-hop is beyond Grandmaster Flash, but Grandmaster Flash was one of the first guys to hit those turntables like that. ...\n",
      "The same thing with Wu-Tang. You'll see the difference in hip-hop from the moment we came in to before we came in. We changed it. We changed the whole structure.\n",
      "CNN: Have you accomplished everything you've set out to accomplish?\n",
      "RZA: I'm me and the me that's me is me and is going to continue to be me, and it's always reaching and growing. I'm grateful for what I've accomplished. I'm grateful for anyone who thinks I accomplished something and says, \"Well he did this; he did that.\" I'm proud to be accepted, but I feel like I've just scratched the surface for some weird reason.\n",

Even though Nora didn't publicize her illness, do you think she'd be on some level pleased with you writing about it? Perhaps she'd be disappointed if you hadn't?\n",
      "Delia Ephron: Thank you. My mother didn't say everything is copy, although for writers everything is copy. She said \"take notes,\" when she was in the hospital and she was dying. But she didn't say it to me. She said it to Nora. To me she said, \"I hope you never tell anyone what happens here.\" So, mixed messages. I write about that.\n",
      "Nora always said we shared half a brain, and we loved one another's work. I know she would appreciate this book. But she also said to me, about herself, \"What is there left to say? I've said everything.\" Nora was rarely wrong, but she was wrong about that. It was a joy to write about her and it helped me a lot to do it.\n",
      "CNN:  You make the point in your book that there's no right way or wrong way to deal with terminal illness, even if you're a celebrity. Nora chose to keep her diagnosis private, while writer Christopher Hitchens went public with his. Why do you think it's difficult for some to accept that different people have different ways of approaching the end of their lives?\n",
      "Ephron: Death is scary. It makes people frightened, upset, angry, and sad. How could it not? In Nora's case, I understood ... if you don't tell a friend that you are seriously ill, how shocking and upsetting that discovery must be. (Friends might ask themselves), \"How close were we, should I have noticed?\" (There is) a sense of betrayal and a desire to have been of help. And when people read you and love you through your work as they did with Nora, in their hearts they have a relationship. Or maybe some people are just judgmental. I have noticed that people are a tad judgmental, myself included.\n",
      "CNN: It's a very poignant and emotional book in places, yet there is also plenty of humor and fun nostalgia. You and Nora wrote the film \"You've Got Mail.\" Who would you rather be stuck in an elevator with, Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan?\n",
      "Ephron: Meg, because she's more likely to be carrying a bottle of water and we might get dehydrated.\n",
      "CNN: I'm a huge Diane Keaton fan and I got kind of nervous while reading the essay in which you describe a film adaptation of one of your novels, \"Hanging Up,\" that she directed. Was that a bad experience? Please don't ruin Diane Keaton for me.\n",
      "Ephron: I am so sorry that I made you nervous. In my book I am writing about the complicated nature of collaboration, and about how movies belong to directors, not to screenwriters. \"Hanging Up\" the movie belongs to Diane Keaton. \"Hanging Up\" the novel belongs to me.\n",
      "CNN: You write lovingly about your dog, Honey. Is she really on a kangaroo diet? What does that entail? Because it sounds kind of sketchy.\n",
      "Ephron: Sketchy? I buy dog food made of kangaroo and feed it to her. Honey loves it. Do you mean, how could kangaroo food cure her tendency to chew her paw? Well the truth is, it did for several months but then, just recently, she started chewing her paw again, just in time for publication. Maybe she's having anxiety about being written about. She's a very private dog.\n",
      "CNN: Obviously, \"Sister Mother Husband Dog (etc.)\" is a book that's very much about family. In addition to you and Nora, your sisters Amy and Hallie are also writers. Was there/is there much competition? And how tired are you of people asking you what it's like being from a family of celebrated writers?\n",
      "Ephron: Since much of \"Sister Mother Husband Dog\" is about what it's like to come from my family, I can't really get upset if someone asks me about my family. In fact I'm thrilled.\n",
      "As for competition, siblings are basically uncivilized. My first memory of Nora was of her biting into a tomato in such a perfect way as to squirt juice in my eye. But, coming from a family of writers, we all take pains to respect one another's work and feel that we all have a right to write what we want. That's what we strive for. And mostly we succeed.\n",

      "And then it depends on what roles are needed. If we need to fly somebody that is going to be the commander of the space station, frequently most often that is somebody who has experience flying; if we need somebody who is going to be doing space walks, we need somebody that can do that. Back when we were flying the shuttle, there were a lot more specific tasks doing robotics ops and the space walks.\n",
      "TIMELINE: 50 years of women in space\n",

      "They come back to Earth after three to six months in space and have long term vision problems, changes in their vision. We are trying to figure out what exactly is causing that.\n",
      "Luca (Parmitano) and I have been involved in numerous tests. We're doing tonometry -- we are looking at the pressure of the eye. We are doing ultrasounds to look at the morphology of the eye, we are doing fundoscopy to take images of the retina, vision tests.\n",
      "We are hoping that we can determine exactly what is causing this and hopefully mitigate the problem, especially if we start longer duration missions going to Mars ... we really need to understand this so we don't degrade the vision of every astronaut that is going into space.\n",
      "CNN: A commenter on CNN.com Marik asks what do you think of the Mars One project which aims to privately settle people on the planet?\n",
      "KN: I think it would be interesting. I think there are a lot of challenges and a lot of things that need to be figured out before that can be a successful mission.\n",

      "KN: It's actually quite comfortable sleeping in space. We have sleeping bags that we hang from the wall. The first couple weeks when I was here, it was very important to me to feel like I was almost laying on something. I would lay with my legs sideways in the sleeping back so that I felt pressure along my back from one side of the sleeping bag and I felt pressure from my legs on the other side.\n",

      "And I actually did meet her last year for a brief moment before traveling to Baikonur as a back up for one of the missions. It was just (a) fantastic opportunity to get to meet her.\n",

      "There is something about learning how to learn that I think is very important is a very broad spectrum. And the same for college, a lot of the classes you take you are like, you think to yourself 'I'm never going to use this.' And you know what, sometimes you don't ... But a lot of it you do use.\n",

      "I've seen some mountain ranges that are just absolutely incredible ...

      "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is using his claims of a successful rocket launch to shore up his political strength within his country.\n",
      "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses North Korea on CNN's \"American Morning\" on Tuesday.\n",
      "Albright, who was secretary of state in the Clinton administration, told CNN's \"American Morning\" that \"it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea\" when the Bush administration took over.\n",
      "The communist nation launched the rocket over the weekend in defiance of international opposition. Satellite images released Monday appear to show the rocket in flight, according to a  nonprofit institution that focuses on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.\n",
      "The following is a transcript of Albright's conversation with CNN's Carol Costello.\n",
      "Carol Costello, CNN: We do have this video from North Korea of this rocket taking off. What do you make of that?\n",
      "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: Well, I think that the North Korean leadership is living in a parallel universe of acting as if the launch was a success, when tracking and everything has shown that in fact, it is a failure.\n",
      "And I think it proves a point, which is that the North Koreans, Kim Jong-Il is doing this for his own internal reasons -- because on Thursday, tomorrow, there will be a rubber stamp by the parliament of his leadership -- and the problems that he's generally had since he had his stroke. So this is part of their kind of Orwellian approach of saying that \"This is what happened, and wasn't it a success,\" when we know it wasn't.\n",
      "Costello: The U.N. Security Council hasn't been able to come up with any sort of resolution because apparently that body is split. President Obama made a really big deal of this and said this was like a clear violation. It sort of seems like the United States is stuck, and it can't do anything about North Korea.\n",
      "Albright: Well, I don't think that's true, because what has happened is there have been individual condemnations by leaders of various countries. And I have to say from my own experience of the United Nations, it does take a while to get the 15 members [of the Security Council] together. But the saddest for me is the fact that the U.N. passed a resolution, 1718, which said that this was not acceptable. So the truth is that the U.N. has to live up to its own resolutions.\n",
      "And Ambassador Rice, I think, is working very hard up there in order to get some action, but there have been condemnations already throughout the world. And the bottom line here is that President Obama's speech, for instance, in Prague, when he talked about the importance of cooperation generally on a whole nonproliferation regime -- it's very clear that there's going to have to be a lot of work on that and that President Obama laid out a very, very important set of goals.\n",
      "amFIX: Your thoughts on the rocket launch\n",
      "Costello: And, you know, there has been some criticism that President Obama turned to the U.N. to try to solve this crisis. I want to read you a quote from Politico. It interviewed Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. I want to read you his quote. Newt Gingrich said, \"The embarrassing repudiation of the United States appeal to the United Nations Security Council Sunday afternoon is a vivid demonstration of weakness. This is beginning to resemble the Carter administration's weakness in foreign policy.\" How would you respond to that?\n",
      "Albright: Well, I think that it's just kind of typical of Newt Gingrich, frankly. But the bottom line here is, I think the United States and President Obama has made very clear the leadership of the United States, his concern about, generally, proliferation issues.\n",
      "I think his trip, for instance, laid out a whole set of issues that prove that American leadership is essential, the respect that he gained for American leadership. And I think you're going to see additional ways that we all work together, because the issues that are out there that have to be dealt with require cooperation, and they will require international organizations and cooperation through NATO and a number of activities. So I'm very confident that President Obama is going to be able to prove American leadership.\n",
      "Costello: Well, I guess many Americans look at it this way, you know: You talk about sanctions, but sanctions have been instituted against North Korea before, and it hasn't really worked. North Korea just seems to kind of do what it wants. You've met Kim Jong-Il. I mean, what does he want?\n",
      "Albright:  Well, what he wants is respect. And I have to say that part of the problem here is -- and as you mentioned, I met Kim Jong-Il. We were in the middle of negotiations with him. In fact, we had a missile moratorium.\n",
      "And President Bush came in and canceled those talks. It was confusing to everybody. And I do think that what is important now is to get the North Koreans back into the six-party talks, to make it clear to them that the only way that they are going to have respect is to abide by international regulations and to try to deal with the fact that they would be better off if, in fact, they allowed their people to be fed and an economy that functions, rather than be living in this way where poverty is rampant, and hunger, in every way in North Korea, and a leadership that is shaky.\n",
      "But the bottom line is, I think it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea. And in the interim period, they were able to develop material in order to create nuclear weapons, and so I hope very much that the six-party talks continue.\n",
      "Costello: We'll see. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. Thank you.\n",

      "(CNET)  -- At a hacker conference no one is safe.\n",
      "Demographic of Defcon conference for hackers is older, wiser and employed.\n",
      "When I first went to Defcon in 1995, the halls were mobbed with teenagers and attendees seemed more concerned with freeing Kevin Mitnick and seeing strippers than hacking each others' computers.\n",
      "Jump forward to Defcon 17 this year, which was held over the weekend in Las Vegas, things certainly have changed. The attendees are older and wiser and employed, most of the feds aren't in stealth mode, and even the most savvy of hackers is justifiably paranoid.\n",
      "\"Welcome to the hacker world,\" said Defcon founder Jeff Moss.\n",
      "The evolving demographic of Defcon attendees shows that the hacker community, like all of us, is aging. But it's also a reflection of how the threat landscape has changed. Web site defacements have given way to much more serious risks like financial fraud and unaddressed critical infrastructure weaknesses.\n",
      "It's a cornucopia of phishing e-mails, cross-site scripting attacks that poke holes in trusted Web sites, and criminals harvesting credit card numbers and selling them on the underground equivalent of eBay with guarantees of service and support.\n",
      "Defcon and Black Hat, the pricier and more corporate sister confab held the two days preceding Defcon ($120 for Defcon registration versus $1,395 to $2,095 for phased registration at Black Hat), offer a forum for researchers to share information about vulnerabilities they find in software, hardware and systems.\n",
      "Targeted this year were everything from the iPhone and surveillance video feeds to e-parking meters and security underlying the Domain Name System.\n",
      "Vendors and users weren't the only ones who need worry. Attendees had plenty to fear and security experts themselves weren't spared.\n",
      "On July 27, Web sites belonging to a handful of security researchers and groups were hacked and passwords, private e-mails, IM chats, and potentially sensitive documents were exposed on the vandalized site of security golden boy Dan Kaminsky. (Mitnick, whose jailing in the '90s for computer crimes made him a cause celebre at \"Free Kevin\" benefits at Defcon at the time, was among those attacked.)\n",
      "There were more widespread threats at the shows, too. Anyone using the Wi-Fi networks at the events had better be careful lest they get their password sniffed and posted on the Wall of Sheep. Then there was the USB thumb drive that was passed around among attendees of Black Hat that was found to be infected with the Conficker virus.\n",
      "Reporters who aren't nearly as geeky as the sources they interview are always easy prey. One reporter was concerned about being hacked via the local area network in the press room after a rare Blue Screen of Death crashed his laptop.\n",
      "Last year, three French men were expelled for sniffing the press room LAN at Black Hat. They said they had obtained eWeek's and CNET's passwords but failed to prove the CNET allegation.\n",
      "This year, three South Koreans registered as press were ejected for asking questions that led organizers to believe were on an intelligence-gathering mission instead of merely reporting, according to the IDG News Service.\n",
      "I had a panic of my own at Defcon this year. I was connected to the Internet using an EVDO wireless card and a virtual private network and was startled a short while later when a Web page opened up out of the blue and I noticed the VPN was disconnected. Granted it looked like a legitimate page for my wireless carrier, but not wanting to take any chances I immediately logged off.\n",
      "(See \"Defcon: What to leave at home and other do's and don'ts\" for tips on how to best protect yourself.) Unfortunately, I had neglected to disable the Wi-Fi on the laptop.\n",
      "Because Windows XP event logging is lacking, it's not clear whether someone may have spoofed the name of a wireless network the laptop is configured to automatically connect to. Time to call the help desk.\n",
      "At least I didn't use any automatic teller machines at the hotel. Defcon organizers confirmed on Monday that a fake ATM was discovered in a lobby of the Riviera Hotel where the event was held, right near the hotel security office. The ruse was up after someone looked through the camera hole using a flashlight and saw a PC inside.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Chris Paget, a security expert who works at Google, reported on Twitter that he lost $200 from a compromised ATM at the Rio Hotel over the weekend. There are multiple Diebold ATMs with the skimmers inside at the Rio casino, he tweeted, later adding: \"Secret Service just called back. They're taking it seriously, reading between the lines it seem(s) like there's more going on here.\"\n",
      "There is no evidence that the fake Riviera ATM was planted by anyone at Defcon, and in all likelihood the hacked Rio ATM was not associated with the hacker show.\n",
      "Heightening the paranoia at Defcon was the report from event organizers on Saturday that there was a confirmed Trojan on the CD the conference hands out to all attendees. The report turned out to be false.\n",
      "Also arousing suspicion were the Defcon badges, which featured a built-in microphone, LED, digital signal processor, and custom circuit boards designed to be hacked as part of a contest. I prudently popped the battery out of my badge after discussing the microphone capability with another journalist. Some attendees chose not to wear the badges at all, even without the battery, tucking them in satchels and digging them out every time they needed to display them.\n",
      "As it does every year, Defcon also had its share of stupid attendee tricks--one arrest reportedly for carrying a concealed weapon and another for bungee jumping off the hotel roof.\n",
      "But those are par for the course when you mix booze and rebellious youth trying to out-impress each other. It was the other stuff--the hacking and viruses and sniffing--that made me and others at the show jumpy.\n",
      "Security guru Bruce Schneier, however, brushed it off as the mere cost of doing business.\n",
      "\"This is the way hackers play,\" he said. \"This is the experimental battlefield. It's not bad; it is just what it is. Defcon has an important place in computer security.\"\n",

      "Buffett is 81, and became chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway in 1970, just as the term was starting to fade. Tannen has an assistant, but if she'd had a helper 30 years ago, she probably would have called her a secretary, she said.\n",
      "Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's longtime secretary, has never publicly questioned the title, and has garnered a bit of fame from her workplace in Omaha, Nebraska. She even attended the State of the Union as a guest of the White House this year.\n",
      "\"The word secretary, for many people, is associated with an earlier time when those jobs were held exclusively by women and women were limited to jobs like that,\" Tannen said.\n",
      "The National Secretaries' Association was founded in 1942 as a professional network for the growing number of women entering secretarial ranks during World War II. There were limited job opportunities for women, and the title of secretary could have some cachet. But to be a secretary was still seen as women's work over which the glass ceiling loomed large, spokesman Ray Weikal said.\n",
      "By 1998, the organization had evolved into the International Association of Administrative Professionals to encompass the growing variety of job titles and to recognize the advancing role of administrative support staff, said Weikal, who, by the way, goes by the title communications specialist.\n",
      "\"Over time, being a secretary became increasingly more complex and secretaries were expected to master a range of very technical jobs. In many cases, they were the ones pushing for the adoption of electric typewriters and fax machines, and they were very often the ones integrating those kinds of technology into the office,\" he said.\n",
      "\"People who had those jobs increasingly felt the title frankly did not represent who they were as professionals, so you started to see the development of other job titles.\"\n",
      "The shift was also about overcoming stigma, said Lynn Peril, author of \"Swimming in the Steno Pool: A Retro Guide to Making it in the Office.\"\n",
      "\"The term secretary really did not have much positive connotation by the mid-1970s because so much cultural baggage had been attached to it by that time,\" she said.\n",
      "What kind of baggage, exactly? Peril has a Pinterest board dedicated to the topic, and anyone who has seen an episode of \"Mad Men\" knows the markers: typists who take dictations and write memos but also serve as buxom eye candy and objects for an extramarital fling.\n",
      "It's the kind of baggage that made secretaries the subjects of pulp novels with titles like \"Office Affair\" and \"The Schemers\" and the purported case study, \"Sex and the Secretary.\" A more Nancy Drew-ish book series \"Private Secretary\" drew upon themes of small town girls looking for love in the big city.\n",
      "\"Not every secretary was a feminist,\" Peril said, \"but one of the things they realized from the feminist movement was they wanted to be treated with respect and one way to achieve that was to jettison the title 'secretary.'\"\n",
      "That's not to say the title is gone. By day, Peril is a legal secretary, and says she doesn't mind the title.\n",
      "Of the 22,000 members in the administrative professionals' association, 15% identified as secretaries in 2010, up from 7% in 2009, Weikal said. He has no real explanation for it, but speculates it might be driven by nostalgia.\n",
      "\"I call it the 'Mad Men' effect. I don't have concrete evidence for that, but anecdotally, there's evidence to suggest there may be a culture shift to use the title secretary.\"\n",
      "Perhaps a better question: Does it matter? Not according to several secretaries we talked to.\n",
      "\"I think everyone is on their toes about being politically correct. But I don't think it matters,\" said Jasmine Garnes, a 30-year-old executive assistant at a commercial real estate company in Atlanta. Her responsibilities run the gamut from scheduling meetings to organizing conferences. As long as the paycheck clears, \"It's basically the same job with a different title. It means you have a job.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "SUMMARY\n",
      "Term \"secretary\" faded in an effort to distance profession from smutty stigma.\n",
      "As secretaries' duties expanded, many felt the title no longer fit the role.\n",
      "Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's longtime secretary, has never publicly questioned the title.\n",
      "Many executive assistants and administrative support staff say the title is meaningless.\n",

      "(CNN)Morocco is undeniably becoming a strategic platform to address the African continent. An increasing number of global companies choose to step in, first in Morocco, to then gain a faster access to other African markets. Its geographic proximity to Europe, its political stability and its competitive workforce constitute a powerful advantage.\n",
      "This is especially true for the aeronautics sub-contracting market. However, the country has still a long way to go to be among the top performers in this sector.\n",
      "The Moroccan aeronautics sector is enjoying an annual growth rate of 15% to 20% (with a slight softening to 13.8% in 2013 according to the Moroccan Office des Changes). Today, over 100 companies in the aeronautical sector are based there, employing over 8,000 people in total.\n",
      "This market is generating a turnover of around 800 million euros which represents 5% of Morocco's total exports, and the industry is one of the top priority sectors in Morocco's Industrial \"Emergence plan.\" Factories are expanding and companies are recruiting to support their growth. According to the Moroccan Space and Aeronautical Industries Group, the sector is likely to double in size by 2020.\n",
      "Nevertheless, in order to become a heavyweight player in the sub-contracting market, Morocco will need to manufacture more complex components and improve its training programs to meet the needs of global aircraft manufacturers.\n",
      "Indeed, several countries are competing in the sub-contracting market such as Mexico, India or Malaysia. Even though the Moroccan aerospace and defense sector was in the worldwide top 8 recipients of inward investment between 2001 and 2011, some of its competitor countries offer lower-priced labor.\n",
      "Consequently, Morocco has to counterbalance by producing more complex parts and by improving the efficiency of its local supply chain (i.e. licensing local distributors).\n",
      "To become a key player and to attract global manufacturers, a significant pool of high-skilled personnel is required. The estimate is that 20,000 people will be needed by 2020 in this industry. This applies mostly to machinists and technicians levels, since there are already enough Moroccan engineers specialized in aeronautics.\n",
      "The Institute of Aeronautics Professions and the ISMALA were hence established to quickly redirect and complement Morocco's public sector educational system which was not taking aeronautics as a priority.\n",
      "Since then, more than 1,500 people have graduated from these institutes but aeronautics manufacturers still have to train young machinists in-house for an average of two years before they are completely up to speed.\n",
      "Another influential factor for Morocco's aeronautics industry future is Bombardier's on-going establishment in the country scheduled to open at the end of this year; first plant on the African continent enabling the company to sell several of its aircrafts, well suited for the continent needs. This location choice is not random, but largely due to Moroccan incentives and tax benefits (not revealed but said to be close to $20 million).\n",
      "This calculated move by the Moroccan authorities will have a big impact on the aeronautics industry and provide multiple business opportunities in this sector, especially for sub-contractors.\n",
      "The government also created a free zone for aeronautics companies close to Casablanca's airport. The American company Alcoa Fastening Systems has already chosen to set up there and will benefit from VAT and corporate tax exemption among other incentives.\n",
      "In 2012, Morocco's aeronautics exports exceeded its imports for the first time. The country has already achieved to attract several major global players but it seems that they are not yet planning to produce entire airplanes in the country.\n",
      "Morocco needs to overcome its training challenge and create more added-value to be able to succeed in the aeronautics sector. If it does, Morocco will have put Africa on the map of the aeronautics sector.\n",

      "But historians say Kris Kringle was originally created to keep adults, not children, off the naughty list. Being crafty codgers, we ducked Santa's surveillance, turning the spotlight on kids and dramatically changing Christmas celebrations.\n",
      "How did we achieve this very important historical victory?\n",
      "Picture this: It's the early 1800s, and America's Christian leaders -- most of whom were Protestant Reformation-types -- had banned religious celebrations of Christmas as unscriptural and paganish.\n",
      "But people still wanted to party. Because, why not? It was midwinter, the crops were harvested and sailors were waiting for better weather to disembark.\n",
      "So, on December 25, working-class stiffs got fall-down drunk and stumbled around cities looking for stuff to loot.\n",
      "Imagine Black Friday, spring break and New Year's Eve -- then smash them together like sumo wrestlers full of saki. That was Christmas in the early 1800s.\n",
      "A bunch of blue-blood New Yorkers decided all this fun must stop.\n",
      "\"They wanted to domesticate Christmas, bring it indoors, and focus it on children,\" says Gerry Bowler, author of \"Santa Claus: A History,\" and professor of history at the University of Manitoba in Canada.\n",
      "These grinches, who formed the Saint Nicholas Society of New York, would change the world with two little poems. Yep. Poems.\n",
      "But let's back up for a minute.\n",
      "When the Dutch came to the New World in the 1600s, they brought a fellow from folklore named Sinterklaas with them, Bowler says.\n",
      "Sinterklaas, who wore a red bishop's miter and a snowy white beard, was based on St. Nicholas, a 3rd century Greek who lived in modern-day Turkey.\n",
      "Despite being a bishop, this Nick was a bit of a bad boy.\n",
      "An archaeologist who dug up his bones in 2005 found that Nicholas had a broken nose, perhaps a result of the persistent persecution of Christians around that time, said Adam C. English, author of \"The Saint Who Would be Santa Claus.\"\n",
      "Or could it have been Christian-on-Christian violence?\n",
      "According to one medieval legend, Nicholas punched a heretic in the nose at the Council of Nicea -- the meeting in 325 that formed the first consensus on Christian doctrine. Early icons of Nicholas depict him without bishop's garb, a subtle suggestion that he had been demoted, possibly for fisticuffs.\n",
      "Alas, the Nick at Nicea rumor is not true, said English. But people seem to love the story, which pops up like poinsettias on the Internet this time of year.\n",
      "Thankfully, St. Nicholas, was known for more than brawling. He also had a reputation for giving gifts and protecting children.\n",
      "The first quality comes from a story about a poor man with three young daughters. Without a dowry to offer suitors, the man worried that his daughters would fall into prostitution. Legend has it that Nicholas dropped three bags of gold through an open window in the man's house, saving the women from the streets.\n",
      "The second story is a bit macabre: While staying at an inn, Nicholas discovered three dismembered children in pickle barrels. He reassembled and resurrected the briny kids and punished the guilty innkeeper.\n",
      "These deeds, along with his everyman persona, (he wasn't a martyr or hermit like so many other model Christians of the time), made Nicholas the greatest male saint of the Middle Ages, said Bowler. One measure of his popularity is the looong list of people, places, churches and Christian groups that list St. Nick as their patron.\n",
      "Bowler, Santa's biographer, says that St. Nick's feast day, December 6, (the day he supposedly died) was celebrated across Europe for hundreds of years, often by giving gifts to children.\n",
      "But, beginning in the 1500s, the Protestant Reformation swept away the cult of Christian saints, denouncing them as unbiblical and idolatrous. Christmas, too, went pretty much by the wayside for much of Protestant Europe during this time.\n",
      "Some countries, though, such as the Netherlands, kept alive traditions associated with Sinterklaas. And it was these customs that 19th century New Yorkers wanted to revive.\n",
      "As they sought to make Christmas more family friendly, the Saint Nicholas Society found the perfect front man in their namesake, who, after all, was known for being nice to children.\n",
      "It was a genius move. The real goal was getting drunks off the street, remember? Now they could do that by turning Christmas into a family event when children -- who had it pretty rough back then -- would receive gifts for good behavior.\n",
      "But the Knickerbockers needed more than good cheer to change Christmas. They needed stories.\n",
      "Drawing on the Dutch legends about Sinterklaas, the American author Washington Irving wrote a series of sketches featuring St. Nicholas soaring high above New York houses, smoking a pipe and delivering presents to well-behaved children.\n",
      "About a decade later, in 1821, an anonymous poem called \"The Children's Friend,\" featured a magical figure called \"Santeclaus,\" who drove a reindeer-led sleigh full of \"rewards\" and filled obedient children's stockings with little presents.\n",
      "Building on that, an Episcopalian scholar named Clement Clarke Moore wrote a poem for his big brood called \"A Visit From St. Nicholas.\"  It's now better known as \"The Night Before Christmas.\"\n",
      "Strangely for a seminary professor, Moore's poem strips St. Nick of religious rhyme and reasons. Nicholas wears a fur suit, clambers down chimneys and gives presents to good children. But he says nothing about the \"reason for the season,\" as contemporary Christmas warriors like to say.\n",
      "Still, Moore's St. Nick story went viral, spreading across the northeastern United States faster than reindeer on Ritalin.\n",
      "In some early depictions, Santa Claus looks like an overgrown elf; in others, he looks kind of scary, as American artists merged St. Nicholas with European traditions such as the German Krampus, who punishes bad children.\n",
      "By the early 1900s, Bowler says, Santa became standardized as the white-bearded, red-suited, twinkle-eyed benevolent grandfather that we all know and love. And we're not the only ones.\n",
      "\"Merchants seized on this guy right away,\" Bowler says. \"They immediately saw the possibility that this personification could be useful in their selling.\" In other words, Santa was pitching products almost as soon as he hitched up his sleigh.\n",
      "But before you blame Kris Kringle for commercializing Christmas, think back to what it was like before he came to town, when kids -- and many adults -- really had something to pout about.\n",

      "To Sam McNair, a 17-year-old high school senior in Duluth, Georgia, it was an innocent hug.\n",
      "\"You never know what someone's going through,\" McNair told CNN affiliate WGCL in Atlanta. \"A hug might help.\"\n",
      "It didn't in this case because after McNair hugged a teacher, he ended up with a year-long suspension from Duluth High School, putting his college plans in jeopardy.\n",
      "\"He's a senior; he plays football. He was getting ready for lacrosse season, and you are stripping him of the opportunity to even get a full scholarship for athletics for college,\" April McNair, Sam's mother, told WGCL.\n",
      "The elder McNair, who says she and her son call themselves huggers, said she was dumbfounded to learn of her son's suspension after hugging a teacher.\n",
      "Surveillance video captures the hug in question, showing Sam placing his arms around the teacher and giving her a hug. The teacher then pushes him away.\n",
      "According to a discipline report obtained by WGCL, the teacher said Sam's lips and cheeks touched her neck and that she had warned Sam about hugging in the past.\n",
      "Asked if he kissed the teacher, Sam told the television reporter he did not. He said he has hugged teachers many times before, including this teacher, and has never been warned.\n",
      "In a statement, Sloan Roach, a spokesperson for the Gwinnett County Public Schools, told CNN, \"Hearing officers consider witness testimony, a review of the known facts, and a student's past disciplinary history -- including long-term suspensions that result in alternative school placement -- when determining consequences.\"\n",
      "\"If a parent has concerns about the outcome of a panel, he or she is entitled to appeal the decision to the Gwinnett County Board of Education,\" Roach added.\n",
      "Since this is a discipline issue, the law prohibits the district from sharing details about the student's situation or the student's past discipline history, said the spokesperson.\n",
      "Sam told WGCL he does have a discipline record and previous suspensions but not for sexual harassment.\n",
      "\"I have five months left in my senior year. I don't see why they would take that away from me,\" said Sam.\n",
      "His mother plans to appeal the school board's decision and said the school should have notified her if there were any problems with his hugging before suspending him and threatening his college future.\n",
      "On her Facebook page, she posted a Change.org petition, calling for the school district to \"revisit a year-long suspension for hugging a teacher.\" The petition had more than 200 signatures as of Monday evening.\n",
      "Reaction online has been mixed, with many believing the punishment might be severe but raising questions about Sam's prior history.\n",
      "\"Our zero tolerance is taken a bit too far, but I have to reserve my comments since I am curious what his 'previous records' of suspension were about, as well as his disciplinary record,\" said Sue Scheff, a parenting advocate.\n",
      "\"But I don't think hugging constitutes sexual harassment unless he has intent otherwise and it doesn't seem that way,\" said Scheff.\n",
      "Some commenters said the allegation that the teacher raised the issue before with Sam was a key point.\n",
      "\"If she has warned him before and he did it again and his hand or face touches her where she believes it's inappropriate, like (the) neck or breast, it's textbook sexual harassment,\" said a viewer on WGCL's website.\n",

      "There is a good chance NATO pressure will encourage Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi to leave power, the U.S. NATO commander told Congress Tuesday, but the opposition that could come in the Libyan leader's wake has \"flickers\" of al Qaeda.\n",
      "While there is a wide range of possible outcomes in Libya, running from a static stalemate to Gadhafi cracking, there is a \"more than reasonable\" chance of Gadhafi leaving power, Adm. James Stavridis said before the Senate Armed Services Committee,\n",
      "But potential \"flickers\" of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the Libyan opposition, which is poised to take power if Gadhafi leaves, Stavridis said. However, he added there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. Stavridis is also the commander of U.S. European Command.\n",
      "\"The intelligence that I'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi,\" Stavridis added.\n",
      "The comments come the same day as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of Libya's opposition in London. Clinton and the heads of 40 other countries met Tuesday to discuss Libya's future.\n",
      "A senior counterterrorism official, unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record, backed up Stavridis' assessment, downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition.\n",
      "There is probably \"a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda\" in Libya among the rebels, \"but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates,\" the official said. Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years. It \"wouldn't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful\"-- of extremists or al Qaeda are in Libya.\n",
      "\"It's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition,\" the official said, but \"the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya.\"\n",
      "If Gadhafi's forces cease fighting there would be a series of decisions on how NATO should proceed. Leading the senators through the NATO command chain, Stavridis said the intelligence and ground assessments would work their way up through NATO, first going through Canadian Gen. Charles Bouchard leading the NATO operation in Libya, then up to Stavridis and eventually going up to the United Nations for the ultimate decision on course of action, Stavridis said.\n",
      "\"I think there would be actually another level that this discussion would have to go to, which would be the United Nations since the authority for NATO to participate in this operation is under the United Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973,\" Stavridis pointed out.\n",
      "During this process there would be a pause in NATO activity over Libya.\n",
      "But for now the fight is still very much on. No-fly air zones have been set up to allow air assets to strike Libyan forces if the civilian population is threatened, Stavridis said, going beyond a basic no-fly zone patrol mission.\n",
      "For the first time, A-10 and AC-130 ground attack aircraft were used over the weekend in Libya, Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a press briefing on Monday. These aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons, up to thousands of rounds a minute, and due to their low-altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas. On Monday night, one A-10 aircraft attacked Libyan coast guard ships in the port of Misrata after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels.\n",
      "NATO is set to take control of the full operation in Libya including protecting civilians on Thursday, greatly easing the financial costs on the United States, which has already hit $550 million as of Monday, according to Pentagon figures. Of those costs, 60% were for munitions, the Pentagon said, including Tomahawk missiles, which cost $1.4 million each. The United States has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation.\n",
      "\"Future costs are highly uncertain,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kessler said, but the U.S. expects to incur another $40 million in costs over the next three weeks. After the transition to NATO control is complete, the Pentagon expects the cost of the U.S. support operation to drop significantly, costing $40 million per each subsequent month.\n",

      "For the past few decades when talking about malaria, public health officials and malaria experts have avoided the word \"eradication.\"\n",
      "This reluctance is based in part on relatively recent history. In 1955, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a valiant effort to eradicate malaria throughout the world.\n",
      "Although the disease was virtually eliminated in many temperate regions and reduced in some tropical areas, the goal of worldwide eradication fell short, and the effort ultimately was abandoned.\n",
      "Today, malaria has resurged with a vengeance. Half the world's population is at risk of malaria infection. Approximately 250 million people get sick with malaria each year and nearly a million individuals die -- mostly young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "So when Bill and Melinda Gates dared to resurrect the \"E\" word in 2007, many in the public health community were skeptical and said in private conversation, \"It can't be done.\"\n",
      "We at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initially leaned toward the views of the large chorus of \"eradication skeptics,\" but as the idea began to sink in and we assessed the research landscape, a new sense of optimism emerged. We now believe that malaria eradication -- controlling and eliminating the malaria parasite in every region across the globe -- is possible, but only if we learn from history and our past mistakes.\n",
      "Previous efforts to eradicate malaria failed for several reasons, including political instability and technical challenges in delivering resources, especially in certain countries in Africa. The goal of malaria eradication, although popular among physicians and public health workers, did not muster sustained widespread support among the general public.\n",
      "The diversity of malaria in communities across the globe and the changes in tools and monitoring strategies required over time to achieve eradication were not fully appreciated. And the impact and sustainability of single interventions such as the drug chloroquine and the pesticide DDT were overestimated.\n",
      "Inevitably, malaria parasites developed resistance to commonly used drugs and mosquito vectors became insecticide-resistant. Unfortunately, investments in the research needed to develop new tools was never really adequate. And a sustainable yet flexible infrastructure to deliver the treatment and preventive services that could respond to a changing epidemiology was never developed.\n",
      "It is now widely recognized that any attempt at malaria eradication must be a long-term commitment that involves multiple interventions, disciplines, strategies and organizations. One of the means to develop important new tools critical for the eradication of malaria is through biomedical research.\n",
      "The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recognizes that malaria eradication will require a sustained, multidisciplinary research effort by multiple partners across the globe. Indeed, we are a part of a global initiative recently launched by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation called the Malaria Eradication Research and Development Agenda involving research sponsors, public health agencies and interested organizations throughout the world joined by the common collaborative goal of malaria eradication.\n",
      "As we work toward controlling and eliminating malaria in endemic regions of the world, it will be important to monitor shifts in disease patterns as we achieve success. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes may die out in some regions, but reappear in others.\n",
      "Certain drugs may be successful in reducing the burden and controlling the spread of the malaria parasite, but other parasites may soon emerge to reintroduce or resume the disease.\n",
      "Such changes in the patterns of the disease will require new interventions: diagnostics, drugs and ultimately an effective vaccine. Thus, we must maintain a robust pipeline of new interventions that can substitute for failing ones.\n",
      "In developing a research plan for controlling, eliminating and eventually eradicating malaria, we are confronted by substantial challenges. An immediate challenge is diagnosis.\n",
      "Different species of the malaria parasite exist, and it is important to have sensitive and rapid diagnostics that can detect which species are infecting patients and whether they are resistant to standard malaria drug regimens so that the optimal drugs are administered.\n",
      "As our successes mount, we also will need rapid new diagnostics to detect infected individuals with no symptoms who might re-introduce the parasite into areas where the disease has been controlled or eliminated.\n",
      "A second challenge will be to translate the enormous wealth of basic information about malaria parasites, mosquito vectors and the human host into new intervention strategies. For example, we now know the genetic sequences from Anopheles gambiae, the most important mosquito species for spreading malaria, and for the two major malaria parasites of humans: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. It is a daunting task to translate this information into better ways of blocking transmission and preventing and treating infection.\n",
      "Finally, perhaps our greatest challenge is sustaining our research efforts until the ultimate eradication of malaria. We may run the risk of becoming victims of our own success. Once we find ways to reduce the disease burden and deaths due to malaria, the world may no longer perceive malaria as a major threat and may lose interest.\n",
      "Celebrities, politicians and even health officials may focus their attention on other maladies that pose a more immediate threat. We cannot allow this to happen. Unless we want to face the persistence and even resurgence of malaria in the next century and beyond, we must maintain our resolve to fully eradicate this deadly scourge across the globe. It can be done.\n",

      "A Dallas apartment where the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States had stayed is finally getting a thorough cleaning, days after the diagnosis left four people quarantined there with soiled towels and sweat-stained sheets from the Ebola patient.\n",
      "After some delays, the first of three phases to clean the apartment began Friday afternoon. While the process will take days, at least sheets and towels that Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan used have been removed.\n",
      "Also out are the four people -- the partner of the Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, her 13-year-old son and her two 20-something nephews -- who'd been stuck there for days.\n",
      "They had been ordered to stay inside the apartment until October 19. By that point, enough time should have passed to determine if any of them contracted Ebola or if they're in the clear.\n",
      "Judge Clay Jenkins, director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said Friday that Duncan's partner slept last night on a couch pillow on the living room floor. But now she and the others have a new place to call home in the meantime: a private 4-bedroom residence in Dallas, which was arranged with the help of someone in the local faith-based community.\n",
      "\"They were very glad to be going and very pleased when they got there,\" Jenkins said. \"(One of them) got a big grin on his face, and he said, 'I wish somebody would get me a basketball.' So we're going to see if we can't take care of that.\"\n",
      "The move added to a busy day for the quartet, who until then had gotten little more than brief stops from a health official and were told not to go more than a few steps outside. On Friday, they were visited by a hazardous materials team wearing masks, boots and yellow protective gear, as seen in photos tweeted by Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed. A large tarp was laid out, and several oil-drum like containers were on site.\n",
      "Some have criticized the fact that it took so long to start the process, given that health officials announced three days ago that Duncan had Ebola. At that time, four people Duncan had stayed with in the Texas city were ordered not to leave the apartment because of possible lingering effects of Duncan, from his clothes to toilets to silverware.\n",
      "Additionally, the Dallas hospital where Duncan is being treated has come under fire for how it handled his first visit there eight days ago.\n",
      "Duncan's partner, identified only as Louise, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that hospital medical staff were twice told that Duncan, who was suffering with fever and abdominal pain, had recently arrived from West Africa -- key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola, yet was never properly relayed. Instead, he was released with an antibiotic only to come back by ambulance even sicker on Sunday.\n",
      "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged to reporters Friday that \"there were missteps\" in Dallas as to how Duncan's case was initially treated. But he also insisted that \"there were a lot of things that went right and are going right.\"\n",
      "And Fauci stressed that, while there may be a case here and there, what's happened with Ebola in West Africa -- where more than 3,400 people have died and public health infrastructures have become overwhelmed -- won't happen in the United States.\n",
      "\"Our health care infrastructure in the United States is well-equipped to stop Ebola in its tracks,\" Fauci said.\n",
      "Official: 50 being monitored\n",
      "Until this week, Ebola's impact on the United States has been confined to preemptive measures at airports and elsewhere to stop its spread, the deployment of U.S. military and other resources to West Africa to help corral the outbreak there, and the treatment of a select few Americans who contacted the virus in Africa and were flown back home to get well.\n",
      "But Duncan changed all that.\n",
      "He landed in Dallas on September 20, started feeling sick days later, then made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital late on September 25. He went back three days later and was quickly isolated, with a blood test confirmed he had Ebola on Tuesday.\n",
      "If he gets healthy, Duncan could be in trouble: Some in Liberia have accused him of lying on a pre-flight questionnaire about his contact with Ebola sufferers, leading to threats of charges by authorities there and prompting the Dallas County district attorney's office to announce it is \"looking into whether or not (he) knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter.\"\n",
      "For now, though, any future legal battles are overshadowed by Duncan's fight for his life -- in isolation, in serious condition, at Texas Health Presbyterian.\n",
      "No one he'd come in contact with has shown symptoms of Ebola, though officials were watching them -- 50 people in all -- just in case.\n",
      "These 50 are people Duncan came in contact with while he was contagious. Monitoring means a public health worker visits the contacts twice a day to take temperatures and to ask if they are experiencing any symptoms.\n",
      "Dr. Beth Bell of the CDC said officials are casting a wide net.\n",
      "\"We have a low level of concern about the vast majority of these people that we're following,\" she said.\n",
      "That sentiment was echoed Friday night by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, who pointed out \"there is only one person\" -- Duncan, who is in isolated in a hospital -- \"that is actively showing\" signs of Ebola. Only those showing symptoms of Ebola are contagious.\n",
      "\"We're a little anxious, but there is no fear in our eyes,\" Rawlings said of local residents. \"We will be safe, and we will get this done in the appropriate way.\"\n",

The patient, who was not named, recently traveled to Nigeria and presented with the symptoms upon his or her return, she said. The patient is in stable condition.\n",
      "\"In an abundance of caution, we have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient,\" Hamilton said. \"Our medical team continues to evaluate and monitor progress in close collaboration with the CDC and the Department of Health.\"\n",
      "Officials in Georgia also said they isolated a man with flu-like symptoms who'd recently been in Africa shortly after his arrest early Friday for suspected drunken driving.

      "Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the website's biggest redesign so far, and only a fraction of the website's 800 million users seem to have the slightest clue.\n",
      "I'm not talking about the new real-time \"Ticker\" at the top right of your Facebook profile. I'm not even talking about the \"Top Stories\" that now appear at the top of your Facebook news feed -- those are tiny, insignificant changes compared to what's just around the corner.\n",
      "But boy, did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements. Among my Facebook friends, more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit. Of course, they did no such thing. How will they react when Facebook throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely new?\n",
      "If you use Facebook, chances are you're unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month (full disclosure: Mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with Facebook on a social news app). Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebook's 90-minute announcement of the new profile pages last week.\n",
      "And an even smaller percentage of Facebook users have discovered, like I did, that you can enable the new \"Facebook Timeline\" profile page right now so you're prepared for the launch.\n",
      "So what's the big change? Facebook will be switching profile pages, perhaps optionally at first, to a new format called \"Facebook Timeline.\" I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format. I'm someone who thrives on trying new things, but this change was radical even for me. Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back, so I stuck with it for a few days.\n",
      "I'm so glad I did: Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made.\n",
      "Here's what'll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched: Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two, with boxes of text, photos, videos and even maps of your favorite locations. Rather than just displaying your most recent activities, your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life, all the way back to your birth. Facebook will become a record of your existence: All your memories, your victories and your defeats, your loves, your losses and everything in between.\n",
      "You'll be shocked, as I was, when this change is made. Suddenly your life is laid out before you, the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by Facebook's algorithms. You'll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now, and where all your most recent updates went.\n",
      "You'll add a big, new \"Cover photo\" to your page and waste a few hours preening your Timeline, choosing to feature your happiest memories, hide the inconsequential ones, and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments. And you'll realize, as I did, that Facebook knows you better than you know yourself.\n",
      "Through this process, you'll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence. While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning, or what time you left for work, or where you had lunch, Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events, discards the irrelevant ones, finds the most emotive, the most visual, the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus.\n",
      "Much like our memories, Facebook Timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years. It's a marvel of computer programming: An algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory; perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional response.\n",
      "So yes, you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks. Then, like me, you'll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you didn't even recognize it at first: A meaningful social network. And like any other groundbreaking technology -- the PC, the smartphone, the iPad -- you'll wonder why life wasn't always this way, and how you got by without it.\n",

      "If there's one thing that kills bedroom coziness, home decorators say, it's a bed-in-a-bag set.\n",
      "It might seem like a smart idea to buy everything together, but ultra-coordinated, flat bedding and stiff comforters often found in bagged bedding are the enemy of an inviting bedroom, said Holly Browning, DIY blogger and former home accent and interior designer.\n",
      "\"Fluff is key, like clouds or cotton,\" Browning said.\n",
      "For her, and many decorators who contributed to this week's \"inviting bedrooms\" Open House assignment, the feel of bedding is important. Whether it's crisp, white sheets from a store like Target or expensive, vintage-looking throws from Anthropologie, decorators say it's important to feel like you're sleeping on a cloud.\n",
      "And to get that feel, you must control the fluff. A carefully curated collection of down duvets, mattress pads, quilts and blankets of different thicknesses allow for temperature control and comfort, whether you're fast asleep or sniffling through a miserable flu bug -- and that probably won't come from a preselected, oversized bag, decorators said.\n",
      "But is it just decorator snobbery?\n",
      "When pressed, decor blogger Emily Clark said, \"A bed in a bag can sometimes be a good jumping-off point, if you add some other elements like patterned sheets or different shams.\"\n",
      "Likewise, Browning relented: \"Well, it's OK, really. If you are unsure of what pillows and bedding accessories you like, then buying a bag might be best.\"\n",
      "But she also pointed out that the pillows in said bag are \"not always the softest material,\" and that matters a lot.\n",
      "Pillows\n",
      "Pillows are key, decorators said, and they must be chosen carefully.\n",
      "\"Pillows have always been a big discussion in our house,\" said interior designer and The Little Black Door blogger Elizabeth Baumgartner. \"After a lot of trial and error, I've found that we need at least one king-size synthetic pillow and one regular-size down pillow per person.\" The combination, she said, is perfection.\n",
      "\"I think every bed needs several good pillows besides the decorative kind,\" said Clark. The calming, white master bedroom she decorated is \"the most comfortable place for me in our home,\" she said.\n",
      "Julie Holloway, part of the Milk and Honey Home decorator team from Roswell, Georgia, also finds pillows paramount. \"My husband and I love our Tempur-Pedic pillows that mold to the shape of our neck and head,\" she said. \"Our young boys love them, too, and steal them often.\"\n",
      "Furniture\n",
      "But scratchy sheets aside, comforters that match throw pillows that match curtains, elicit a shudder and \"ugh\" from interior designers like Shannon Berrey. And what of a matched suite of bedroom furniture? They inspired the same kind of disdain.\n",
      "\"Don't do it!\" Berrey pleaded, urging a more eclectic approach.\n",
      "The \"paint by numbers\" mountain vacation bedroom Berrey designed embodies her decorating aesthetic. \"Some vintage pieces, some new, different wood tones, some painted,\" is how she put together a cozy, inviting bedroom for clients.\n",
      "Interior decorator and blogger Bethany Brower said matching bedroom furniture makes her feel \"claustrophobic.\"\n",
      "\"Matching bedroom sets are definitely a buzzkill for me,\" Little House on the Update blogger Corrie Moore said. \"I feel like a bedroom can be uncomfortable if it's too formal.\"\n",
      "Headboards\n",
      "And according to the logic of most bedroom decorating schemes, designers say the bed and headboard are more important than the rest of the furniture. \"A headboard gives the bed a presence in the room,\" Clark said. \"Whether it's a full bed frame or even just a pretty quilt hanging on the wall behind the bed, a headboard makes the room feel more finished.\"\n",
      "\"Important\" doesn't always mean \"expensive.\" Many headboards featured in this week's gallery are DIY projects.\n",
      "\"This spot is so special to my husband and me because we built and upholstered the bed ourselves,\" Kelly Marzka said. \"Every night when we crawl in to sleep, we're reminded of this project we took on, not knowing if we could even do it.\"\n",
      "CNN iReport head-honcho and home decor blogger Katie Hawkins-Gaar is similarly proud of the impact her DIY headboard has on her master bedroom.\n",
      "\"We have an Ikea Malm bed, something that was in our price range when we first bought it, but it never really stood out on its own,\" she said. \"After making a custom headboard, it's like we have a brand new bed! It gave our bedroom so much character and the fact that it's handmade -- it was my husband's first attempt at a project of that scale -- makes it so much more meaningful.\"\n",
      "The large headboard Browning created for her master bedroom reflects her personal style.\n",
      "\"Right now I am loving gray and silver. The corrugated steel roofing I used for this one is shiny and massive,\" she said. \"It's not very feminine but it creates a soft, romantic reflection from the side lamps.\"\n",
      "Lighting\n",
      "Clark also finds that lamps are an indispensable ingredient to an inviting bedroom.\n",
      "\"I recently moved the lamps in our bedroom to another room in the house, and we were with only an overhead light for a couple of months,\" she said. \"It just felt so cold to me.\"\n",
      "Soft light makes a bedroom cozier, she said. So, too, can black-out drapes, or even eye masks and white noise machines. Light-limiting drapes can come in handy for the occasional sick day, Brower said.\n",
      "\"There's nothing worse than being laid up in bed with a cold and it's sunny and wonderful just outside the window. I can pull my drapes shut and block out the sun and pretend I'm not missing out on a glorious day,\" she said.\n",
      "TVs\n",
      "The only thing it seems decorators can't agree on when it comes to bedrooms is whether to put a TV in the room. For some, like Berrey, it's a must.\n",
      "\"I know for so many a TV in the bedroom is a big no-no, but I have to have a TV in the bedroom. I love to lay in bed and watch TV until I fall asleep. It's really the only thing I need; No scented sprays or the sounds of crashing waves, just the sounds of the 'Real Housewives,'\" she said.\n",
      "Even if they think TVs don't belong in bedrooms, decorators confess to it apologetically.\n",
      "\"I know I'm in the minority,\" Baumgartner said, \"but no TV.\"\n",
      "\"I'll be hated for this one,\" said Holloway, who says TVs destroy the cozy vibe of a bedroom. \"Are we not bombarded by screens? If you can swing it, no home office or TV in your bedroom.\"\n",

      "Actor Sean Penn, a friend of Bolivian President Evo Morales, nonetheless angered the South American country's government after his call for the release of a U.S. businessman who has been imprisoned since 2011.\n",
      "Penn, known for his chumminess with Latin America's leftist leaders, is also an advocate for Brooklyn flooring contractor Jacob Ostreicher, whose supporters say has spent two years detained in Bolivia without evidence.\n",
      "At a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting Monday, Penn asked U.S. lawmakers to pressure the sponsors of the off-road Dakar Rally to cancel its planned 2014 route through Bolivia if Ostreicher is not freed.\n",
      "\"The Dakar Rally, one of the world's most prominent displays of freedom and tenacity of the human spirit, will be parading through Bolivia even as thousands of prisoners like Mr. Ostreicher sit in feces-filled cells, forgotten behind locked walls,\" Penn said.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Bolivia's minister of culture shot back.\n",
      "\"The remarks by Mr. Penn are his worst acting in all of his career,\" Pablo Groux said, according to the state-run ABI news agency. \"The remark is offensive to the Bolivian people, totally out of context and lacking any understanding.\"\n",
      "The minister said the actor's comments harkened back to a time when the United States exerted heavy influence in Latin America.\n",
      "\"Those days are long gone,\" Groux said.\n",
      "The rebuke from the Bolivian official is notable coming from a government that Penn has been friendly with.\n",
      "During his testimony before the subcommittee, Penn said that he does not blame Morales for Ostreicher's situation, but endemic corruption in the judiciary.\n",
      "Penn said that he met with Morales last year, with evidence supporting Ostreicher's innocence, and that \"these findings were received by the president with tremendous personal and human grief.\"\n",
      "Ostreicher is under house arrest after spending 18 months in a notorious prison while his case crawled in the overburdened Bolivian judicial system. He was arrested in June 2011 on suspicion of money laundering tied to a rice-growing operation, and he languished in prison without formal charges.\n",
      "He maintained that corrupt officials had trumped up the case, and last year, six government officials were arrested for allegedly extorting and stealing from Ostreicher. But the case against him has not been dropped.\n",

      "The Supreme Court ruled for drug manufacturers Tuesday, deciding that a case brought by a Pennsylvania family who says their child was injured by a vaccine cannot be heard outside of a court created to hear such claims.\n",
      "The Bruesewitz family engaged in what they called a \"fight for justice,\" claiming that a combined disease-prevention booster shot left their then-infant daughter with severe physical injuries.  But the justices, by a 6-2 vote, concluded that drug makers cannot be sued outside a special judicial forum set up by Congress in 1986 to address specific claims over safety.\n",
      "The so-called \"vaccine court,\" which has handled such disputes, was designed to ensure a reliable, steady supply of vaccines by reducing the threat of expensive lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms.\n",
      "It was clear the high court struggled over precisely how the federal statute should be interpreted, and Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said congressional ambiguity in the law played a part in their conclusions.\n",
      "\"The lack of guidance for design defects [in the drugs] combined with the extensive guidance for the grounds of liability specifically mentioned in the act strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability,\" he wrote.\n",
      "At issue was whether such liability claims can proceed in separate state courts, if the vaccine-related injuries could have been \"avoided\" by better product design and if federal officials had approved another, allegedly safer drug.\n",
      "\"Taxing vaccine manufacturers' product to fund the compensation program,while leaving their liability for design defects virtually unaltered, would be an odd way to make vaccine manufacture more effective,\" said Scalia.\n",
      "The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz, a young woman from the Philadelphia area.  They claimed she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of DPT shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. After the third series, according to court briefs, the child began having seizures and became disabled. Hannah, who turns 19 next week, continues to suffer what is described as \"residual seizure disorder,\" and will require lifelong care.\n",
      "The Bruesewitzes alleged Wyeth Laboratories failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine. Court records show the vaccine lot in question produced 65 reports of adverse reactions, including 39 emergency-room visits.\n",
      "The family alleges another vaccine owned by Wyeth -- known as Tri-Solgen -- had proven in earlier tests to result in fewer potential side effects. The Bruesewitzes claim the company and the federal Food and Drug Administration were lax in pushing use of the alternative, potentially safer vaccine. The original drug given to Hannah was discontinued by Wyeth in 1998.\n",
      "The \"vaccine court\" rejected the initial claim, so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in separate state and federal courts. Their lawyers claimed Congress did not intend to block all vaccine-related lawsuits, especially those filed when the harmful side effects were avoidable.\n",
      "Four firms supply vaccines for the U.S. market -- Wyeth, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Co. and Sanofi-Aventis SA.\n",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented in the case, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n",
      "\"Manufacturers, given the lack of robust competition in the vaccine market, will often have little or no incentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are already generating significant profit margins,\" wrote Sotomayor. \"Nothing in the text, structure, or legislative history remotely suggests that Congress intended that result.\"\n",
      "A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer Inc., concluding all design-defect claims were barred under the statute.\n",
      "Despite that victory, the company urged the high court to hear the case, saying it seeks final resolution on the broader legal questions. The Obama administration under then-Solicitor General Elena Kagan also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question.\n",
      "Kagan, now a Supreme Court justice, sat out of the case to avoid a conflict of interest in the eventual ruling.\n",
      "Wyeth and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe, but side effects can occur in very rare cases. They also say the vaccine industry is generally not profitable, but the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business. For that, they say, legal protection provided by Congress is essential to ensure such drugs are widely available and\n",
      "affordable.\n",
      "Doctors' groups applauded the high court ruling.\n",
      "\"Childhood vaccines are among the greatest medical breakthroughs of the last century,\" said Dr. O. Marion Burton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which represents 60,000 physicians. \"Today's Supreme Court decision protects children by strengthening our national immunization system and ensuring that vaccines will continue to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in this country.\"\n",
      "The high court has yet to act on a related pending appeal. The Georgia Supreme Court in 2009 became the first appeals court in the United States to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court. That case involved Atlanta-area parents who claimed their son, Stefan Ferrari, suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots by Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline that contained the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. Now 14, the boy is unable to speak, say his parents, Stefano and Carolyn Ferrari.\n",
      "The preservative has since been taken out of nearly all standard vaccines.\n",
      "Despite winning at the state level, the family has since withdrawn its case, but the liability on drug companies resulting from that decision remains in force in Georgia.\n",
      "The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act was passed to establish a nationwide strategy to ensure a secure vaccine supply, promote safety and future research, and compensate innocent victims. Those goals were listed at the time as a \"top public health priority.\"\n",
      "Lawmakers at the time recognized the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims. Despite FDA approval for the vaccines, pharmaceutical firms claimed they were being driven out of the market. The special federal court created under the legislation was a liability shield, designed to be a reliable, relatively quick, no-fault solution to various claims.\n",
      "Unresolved over the years is whether and when certain exceptions to liability should be in play in specific cases.\n",

      "Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday.\n",
      "Margolin said the investigation was launched at the request of police in Baltimore County, Maryland, where Parente, his wife and their two daughters were found dead in a hotel room earlier this week.\n",
      "\"We're looking into Parente's business interests and whether there's any impropriety there and any crime was committed,\" Margolin said.\n",

      "A law enforcement source told CNN a cell phone belonging to Parente was recovered in the hotel room where the bodies were found. In an attempt to locate surviving family members, investigators contacted people in the phone's directory, and some of those people said they were Parente's investment clients.\n",
      "The New York attorney general's office confirmed it received a complaint alleging financial wrongdoing from attorney Bruce Montague of Queens, New York.\n",
      "CNN spoke with Montague's law partner, Steve Drelich, who said he was speaking on Montague's behalf because Montague is distraught over the death of Parente, whom he considered a personal friend as well as a financial adviser. Drelich confirmed Montague was a client of Parente's, and said the two had known each other about six years and that Montague had been investing with Parente for about that long.\n",
      "Drelich said Montague's estimated losses in investments with Parente total about $450,000.\n",
      "Drelich said recently Montague \"got nervous and asked [Parente] for his money back,\" in light of highly publicized scandals involving other investors and financial advisers.\n",
      "Drelich said when Montague kept asking Parente about the money, he was told \"it was in a Canadian bank and [Parente] was having trouble getting the money back.\"\n",
      "Montague finally received six checks late last week, Drelich said.\n",
      "\"Four of the six checks bounced. We were told there was no money in the account. ... We were told by the bank that the checks were bouncing,\" Drelich told CNN. Drelich said he doesn't know the amounts of the two checks that did clear for Montague.\n",
      "It was not until news broke about the Parente family deaths and apparent murder-suicide investigation that Montague contacted authorities, Drelich said.\n",
      "But Drelich emphasized that Montague was more upset with the deaths than any financial loss.\n",
      "\"You can always make more money,\" Drelich said. \"But Bruce is devastated about the family. He considered [Parente] a friend, but he's especially concerned about the family.\"\n",
      "Drelich said his office received calls from at least five other people who said they invested money with Parente, with callers claiming more than $4 million in total investments with Parente. Drelich said his office referred those callers to the state attorney general's office.\n",
      "Baltimore County police said Parente killed his wife, Betty, 58, on Sunday, April 19, using \"blunt force trauma\" and asphyxiation.\n",

Citing hotel records, police said the room was accessed by its electronic key at around 4 p.m. on Sunday, making it plausible that Stephanie entered the room.\n",
      "Later that evening, police said, Stephanie's college roommate, worried that she had an exam the next morning and hadn't come home, called the room and spoke to William Parente. Parente told the roommate Stephanie would be spending the night. Police believe she was dead at the time.\n",

      "\"It is a very sad day in North Carolina,\" said Tori Taylor, 23, a Charlotte resident who voted against the amendment. \"There were a lot of college students, young professionals who came out to vote. We have gay friends. A lot of us are integrated to that culture. Do you think your friends should have the same rights? It's black and white. Of course, they should.\"\n",

      "\"We are not anti-gay; we are pro-marriage,\" said Tami Fitzgerald, chairwoman of the group. \"And the point -- the whole point -- is simply that you don't rewrite the nature of God's design for marriage based on the demands of a group of adults.\"\n",
      "Experts expressed concerns that the language of the amendment is so vague, it could strip other unmarried couples of some rights as well.\n",
      "It could affect unmarried couples who live together and bring them unintended consequences on issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence, said Kathryn Bradley, a law professor at Duke University.\n",
      "It also strengthens the state's position against same-sex civil unions, often considered a precursor to the marriage issue, Bradley said.\n",

      "\"Despite the relentless lawsuits and attempts to marginalize supporters of traditional marriage, a clear majority of the American people have not given up on standing in support of marriage,\" said Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council. \"But instead, the evidence suggests they want to see it strengthened and preserved for future generations.\"\n",

      "It happened around 4 p.m. in Langtang National Park, said Ramesh Dhamala, president of the Trekking Agents of Nepal. Laxmi Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, said  he was aware of reports about the landslide but wasn't immediately able to confirm details.\n",
      "Quake relief efforts continued Tuesday, but officials warned that they were hampered by problems of getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need.\n",
      "In Kathmandu, a capital city of shattered temples and toppled houses, some people paid their last respects to loved ones taken by the quake.\n",
      "By the Bagmati River, which winds through the city, more than a dozen funeral pyres burned Monday.\n",
      "As workers stoked the flames for the Hindu cremation ceremonies, some mourners shaved their heads in a traditional show of mourning from children who lose their parents.\n",
      "Alongside their father, two teenage brothers from the Gurung family, Ishan and Iman, said goodbye to their mother, Ishara.\n",
      "\"We never imagined this would happen to us. This much pain,\" said Ishan, the elder of the two.\n",
      "Elsewhere in the city, many shaken residents are sleeping in the open. Some have lost their homes, others are afraid to stay in buildings that may be vulnerable to aftershocks.\n",
      "Large encampments of tents have sprung up in open areas, including a wide space belonging to the military in the center of the city that is typically used for parades. One of the grand gates to the field is now just a pile of rubble.\n",

      "Houses and families ripped apart by earthquake\n",
      "The death toll has now climbed above 4,600 in Nepal, officials said Tuesday evening, as rescue and relief efforts continue.\n",
      "Nepal army Lt. Col. A. J. Thapa told CNN's Sumnima Udas that the first 72 hours after the earthquake is the time when the most lives can be saved.\n",
      "\"This is not the time to rest and lament,\" he said. \"This is the time to go out and save lives.\"\n",
      "Thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche.\n",
      "\"Remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help,\" he said. \"We are victim ourselves. ... Despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down, we are trying to build morale, maintain morale and help themselves.\"\n",
      "Thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend.\n",
      "\"Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime,\" he said.\n",
      "Dhakal, the Home Ministry spokesman, put the death toll at 4,620, while Nepal's National Emergency Coordination Center said the number of dead was 4,727. Both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239.\n",
      "Another 72 people died in India, while China reported 25 deaths.\n",
      "Most of the casualty numbers in Nepal are believed to have come mainly from Kathmandu and the surrounding area. They are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas.\n",
      "\"We have incomplete information, but we apprehend the death toll will go up,\" Nepalese Information Minister Minendra Rijal told CNN earlier on Tuesday. \"We cannot say by how much exactly.\"\n",
      "The news agency Reuters cited Prime Minister Sushil Koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was \"on a war footing\" in its rescue and relief work.\n",
      "In a live, televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning, starting Tuesday.\n",
      "The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved. Historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time, he added.\n",
      "At least 90% of 96,000 Nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations, according to Nepal army spokesman Jagadish Chandra Pokharel.\n",
      "More than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help, Koirala said, as he appealed for other nations also to come to Nepal's aid.\n",
      "Even as international aid pours into the country, overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies, people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake's epicenter.\n",

      "Nepal struggles to cope with international aid\n",
      "Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters.\n",
      "\"The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain, we cannot use surface transport much but are using it,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins, but we don't have enough of them.\"\n",
      "Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator for Nepal, told a news conference Tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because Kathmandu's international airport, which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park, is log jammed.\n",
      "The United Nations is aware of the request for tents, he said, but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains.\n",
      "Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added. Nepal's population is about 31 million.\n",
      "At an event in Paris, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of Nepal and called the humanitarian needs \"huge and urgent.\"\n",
      "\"The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts,\" he said. \"I count on the generosity of the international community in Nepal's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed.\"\n",
      "A CNN team that joined a Nepalese military helicopter flight to Dhulikhel, a rural area east of Kathmandu, saw extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley from the air, including many landslides.\n",
      "On landing, the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought. More than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets.\n",
      "Social media posts from Nepal\n",
      "Darvas of World Vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding Gorkha district, which is near the earthquake's epicenter.\n",
      "They included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70% of the houses had collapsed, trapping and crushing the people inside, most of them children and the elderly.\n",
      "Even though aid groups and Nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across Nepal's mountainous terrain, they face daunting challenges getting help to them.\n",
      "\"Some of those villages -- several years ago, before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach. Roads are shut now to some of those villages, so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there,\" Darvas said Monday.\n",

      "\"Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever\" had few fans upon its release in 2002. The $70 million movie, starring Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu, was a box office failure, making just $14.3 million domestically and less than $6 million overseas.\n",
      "Antonio Banderas, above, and Lucy Liu starred as dueling secret agents in 2002's \"Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever.\"\n",
      "And critics were scathing. \"A career low for both Liu and Banderas,\" said Empire magazine. \"Ecks this one off your must-see list,\" wrote the New York Post's Lou Lumenick.\n",
      "But, seven years after its release, \"Ecks\" can now claim one honor: It's the worst movie of the decade, according to RottenTomatoes.com, the movie review aggregator site.  Watch clips from Top 25 worst movies on list »\n",
      "With the aughts winding down and September traditionally a rough month for movies, Rotten Tomatoes decided it was a good time to update an old list of bad movies and look at some of this decade's worst, said Matt Atchity, the site's editor-in-chief.\n",
      "\"We've seen some really, really poorly reviewed movies in the last few weeks,\" he said. \"That kind of made us think ... to update this list and focus on the last 10 years.\"\n",
      "\"Ecks\" received a unanimous thumbs-down, giving it a 0 percent Tomatometer rating. Thirteen other movies in Rotten Tomatoes' horrible hundred also had zero good reviews -- including 2002's \"Pinocchio\" (the Roberto Benigni version) and 2004's \"Superbabies\" (directed by \"Christmas Story\" auteur Bob Clark), but no other movie came close to \"Ballistic's\" expansive perfection: 107 reviews, none good.\n",
      "Atchity said it's rare for a movie to pick up a goose egg on the Tomatometer.\n",
      "\"Usually some [reviewer], somewhere, likes something,\" he said.\n",
      "Besides, Atchity added, it's all relative. Though the oeuvre of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer -- the makers of critically reviled parody films such as \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\" -- included four movies on the worst 100 list, their films routinely do well at the box office.\n",
      "Still, Atchity defends the role of movie critics, themselves much reviled (and, given the struggles of newspapers and the rise of social media, much unemployed) in recent years. Critics may not be able to doom a bad movie, but they can give a boost to small good ones -- and they keep a dialogue going about movies in general, he said.\n",
      "\"I think that criticism in this day and age becomes even more important, because you can't, as a moviegoer, let the studio's marketing arms dictate what you're seeing,\" he said. \"I think it's important as a society that we be discussing the art we're consuming.\"\n",
      "Which brings us back to \"Ecks vs. Sever.\" Could it be an overlooked classic?\n",
      "Well, no.\n",

      "Campaigning resumed in the French presidential election on Thursday following the violent death of shooting suspect Mohammed Merah following a police siege in Toulouse.\n",
      "Merah was wanted for the killings of three French paratroopers and of three children and a rabbi at a Jewish school in the city, in a string of shootings beginning March 11 that shook the nation.\n",
      "Merah had told French police he trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan, and he had planned to attack more soldiers and police, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. He said he was acting alone, the prosecutor added.\n",
      "Most candidates in the election suspended campaigning following the most recent shooting in Toulouse, but normal politics resumed following the bloody end to the siege.\n",
      "How did candidates react to the crisis?\n",
      "Most candidates called for national unity amid the national outpouring of grief for the victims. President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is running for a second term, visited Toulouse and offered his sympathies to bereaved families. Other candidates even flew to the city on the same plane to show their respects.\n",
      "Sarkozy's main rival, Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande, suspended his campaign \"to honor the memories\" of the victims. Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen initially cancelled campaign events, saying politics must be suspended \"as a sign of compassion and solidarity.\"\n",
      "Did the mood of unity hold?\n",
      "In a word, no. Le Pen, who is running in third place in opinion polls, was the first to break ranks with this rare outbreak of political consensus, CNN's Jim Bittermann noted. The National Front leader said \"The danger of fundamentalism has been under-estimated in our country.\"\n",
      "This sparked an angry response from far-left challenger Jean-Luc Melenchon, who accused the National Front of being \"vultures\" feeding at the scene of crimes. Centrist candidate Francois Bayrou accused the extreme right of trying to \"surf\" to power on the back of the attacks.\n",
      "Bayrou, currently in fourth place, refused to suspend his campaign during the hunt for the attackers, and criticized rivals for their anti-immigrant comments, which he said may have provoked the suspect into action. Other candidates said it was impossible to make this link.\n",
      "Was race an issue before the attacks?\n",
      "Along with the economic crisis, immigration and race have been prevalent themes in the campaign for the presidential election, the first round of which takes place next month. Sarkozy declared this month there were \"too many foreigners\" in France, while Le Pen has criticized the production of Islamic halal meat in Paris.\n",
      "Political analyst Simon Persico, from the Center of European Studies in Paris, said Sarkozy won the 2007 election by being right-wing, and taking a strong stance on race, but had found it difficult to maintain this stance while in power. \"In this election, Le Pen is saying the original is better than the copy, and that voters should not believe Sarkozy on race,\" he told CNN.\n",
      "\"Whichever viewpoint is true though, the president has a record of five years of creating conflict, and while he may say he was right to raise the issue of the growth of Islamic fundamentalists in France, maybe now is the time to appease tensions on race.\"\n",
      "How do the public view Sarkozy's handling of the crisis?\n",
      "The president, who had been lagging behind Hollande for most of the campaign, seems to have received an initial political boost from the tragedy, said political commentator Christian Malard, senior analyst for France 3 TV. \"Sarkozy is observed by many people to have been acting well and decisively during the crisis,\" he said. But the socialists were asking why it took more than 30 hours to kill Merah -- and how he could kill so many people while he was under surveillance by security services.\n",
      "\"Sarkozy must tread warily: a year ago he oversaw the ban on Islamic veils in public but he is aware there are six million Muslims in France, half of them from North African former colonies, and he is careful to say few of them are radical.\n",
      "\"So if Sarkozy is to beat Hollande he must win over the electorate of both the center, and the far-right of Le Pen. He needs all the people.\"\n",
      "The crisis could yet have a negative effect on Sarkozy though, with the far-right saying that the government had failed to protect French people from Islamic fundamentalists. Thierry Arnaud, senior political correspondent for BFM TV, said that while Sarkozy had benefited from appearing statesmanlike in recent weeks it remained to be seen what long-term advantage he would gain. \"He is certainly anxious to resume campaigning\" to create momentum, Arnaud noted.\n",
      "What impact will the attacks have on campaigning?\n",
      "Many voters are keen for the political rhetoric to cool and the focus to turn to more mundane matters. The state of the economy and unemployment, especially among the young and ethnic minorities, remains the main concern for most voters. For this reason, as Persico noted, Sarkozy may be keen to keep the focus on security and the Toulouse attacks -- issues on which he looks strong.\n",
      "Before the crisis, Hollande was ahead in the polls thanks to a strong showing on economic issues, Malard said but added that even on this issue the president was gaining ground. \"Lots of people are telling me that between Hollande and Sarkozy, 'we might switch our votes to Sarkozy.'\n",
      "\"This debate between Sarkozy and Hollande is turning into a battle between two heavyweight fighters, but amid the storm of the economic crisis and world upheavals a lot of people are coming back to Sarkozy.\"\n",

      "When Vanessa Hudgens' naked photos hit the Internet, the \"High School Musical\" star quickly apologized. But sending nude or seminude pictures, a phenomenon known as sexting, is a fast-growing trend among teens.\n",
      "Phillip Alpert is a registered sex offender as a result of sending a nude photograph of his 16-year-old girlfriend.\n",
      "The National Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, a private nonprofit group whose mission is to protect children, and CosmoGirl.com, surveyed nearly 1,300 teens about sex and technology. The result: 1 in 5 teens say they've sexted even though the majority know it could be a crime.\n",
      "Phillip Alpert found out the hard way. He had just turned 18 when he sent a naked photo of his 16-year-old girlfriend, a photo she had taken and sent him, to dozens of her friends and family after an argument. The high school sweethearts had been dating for almost 2½ years. \"It was a stupid thing I did because I was upset and tired and it was the middle of the night and I was an immature kid,\" says Alpert.\n",
      "Orlando, Florida, police didn't see it that way. Alpert was arrested and charged with sending child pornography, a felony to which he pleaded no contest but was later convicted. He was sentenced to five years probation and required by Florida law to register as a sex offender.\n",
      "\"You will find me on the registered sex offender list next to people who have raped children, molested kids, things like that, because I sent child pornography,\" says Alpert in disbelief, explaining, \"You think child pornography, you think 6-year-old, 3-year-old little kids who can't think for themselves, who are taken advantage of. That really wasn't the case.\"\n",
      "Alpert's attorney Larry Walters agrees and he's fighting to get Alpert removed from Florida's sex offender registry. The law lags behind the technology, he says. \"Sexting is treated as child pornography in almost every state and it catches teens completely offguard because this is a fairly natural and normal thing for them to do. It is surprising to us as parents, but for teens it's part of their culture.\"\n",
      "In many states, like Florida, if a person is convicted of a crime against children, it automatically triggers registration to the sex offender registry. Thirty-eight states include juvenile sex offenders in their sex offender registries. Alaska, Florida and Maine will register juveniles only if they are tried as adults. Indiana registers juveniles age 14 and older. South Dakota registers juveniles age 15 and older. Most states allow public access to sex offender registries via the Internet and anyone with a computer can locate registered sex offenders in their neighborhoods.  Watch a report on the 'sexting' trend and how police are now getting involved »\n",
      "A number of states have elected not to provide Internet access to registries; Florida is not one of them. There is no hiding for Alpert, whose neighbors, he says, all know. \"I am a sex offender. If you type my name into the search engine online, you will find me.\"\n",
      "As sexting incidents pop up around the country, prosecutors are trying to come to terms with how these cases should be handled. George Skumanick Jr., a district attorney from Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, took a novel approach when 20 students from Tunkhannock High School were caught allegedly sexting.   He gave them a choice: probation and re-education classes or be charged with sexual abuse of a minor. \"An adult would go to prison for this,\" says Skumanick, adding, \"If you take the photo, you've committed a crime. If you send the photo, you've committed a different crime, but essentially the same crime.\"\n",

      "Fifteen-year-old Marissa Miller of northeastern Pennsylvania was 12 when she and a friend snapped themselves wearing training bras. \"I wasn't trying to be sexual,\" she says, \"I was having fun with my friends at a sleepover, taking pictures, dancing to music.\" The picture recently surfaced on a student's cell phone and Marissa's mom, MaryJo Miller, was contacted by Skumanick. \"He told me that he had a full nude photo of my daughter,\" says MaryJo Miller, who calls the picture innocent.\n",
      "Rather than force her daughter to take the classes, which would have required she write a report explaining why what she did was wrong, Miller and two other families ­-- with the help of the ACLU -- are suing the district attorney to stop him from filing charges. \"We believe she was the victim and that she did nothing wrong,\" says  Miller. \"How can I ask her to compromise her values and write this essay, when she didn't do anything?\"\n",
      "Although the district attorney maintains the program is voluntary, the letter he sent to parents notes, \"Charges will be filed against those who do not participate.\" Seventeen of the 20 students caught in the sexting incidents have completed the 14 hours of classes.\n",
      "Skumanick won't comment on the Miller case, but says, \"You can't call committing a crime fun or a prank. If you do that, you can rob a bank because you think it's fun.\" In the majority of sexting cases, it's usually girls sending pictures to boys, who then send them to their friends. Though teens may think it's funny and a way to flirt or even seek revenge after a breakup, there can be dangerous consequences.\n",
      "Last year, Jessica Logan, a Cincinnati, Ohio, teen, hanged herself after her nude photo, meant for her boyfriend, was sent to teenagers at several high schools. For months after, her father says, she was the subject of ridicule and taunts. \"Everyone knew about that photo,\" Bert Logan says. \"She could not live it down.\" On July 3, his wife found her. \"She had been getting dressed to go out. The curling iron was still warm. It was so unexpected,\" Logan says. \"I heard my wife scream, I ran up to Jessie's room, but it was too late.\"\n",
      "No charges had been filed against Jessica's 19-year-old boyfriend, who disseminated the photo, nor had the school taken any action, Logan says. He says he and his wife want to warn parents and students of the dangers of sexting. The Logans are fighting to raise awareness nationally and to advocate for laws that address sexting and cyber-bullying.\n",

He's been kicked out of college, he cannot travel out of the county without making prior arrangements with his probation officer, he has lost many friends and is having trouble finding a job because of his status as a convicted felon. He says he feels terrible about sending the photo of his ex-girlfriend, especially since they were once so close.\n",
      "At the same time, Alpert says, \"I'm being punished for the rest of my life for something that took two minutes or less to do.\" Says attorney Walters, \"Some judges have the good sense and reasonableness to treat this as a social problem and others are more zealous in their efforts to put everybody away and I think it's time as a society that we step back a little bit and avoid this temptation to lock up our children.\"\n",

      "\"Twitter has opened up these porn stars fan bases like nothing the adult film industry has ever seen before,\" said Dan Miller, managing editor of XBiz, an adult industry trade publication. \"Since most mainstream pop culture publications don't cover the porn industry (and) porn movie reviews don't generally appear alongside reviews of big Hollywood movies ... the adult industry has embraced Twitter as a way to reach out directly to fans beyond the typical porn consumer.\"\n",

      "He has made a name for himself by defying stereotypes about male porn stars: he comes off as a funny, slightly goofy boy-next-door. His non-threatening demeanor has made his films popular with younger woman and has led him to more mainstream opportunities.\n",

In April, her mare Regina gave birth and Kross tweeted throughout the process, posting pictures and even asking her followers to help name the foal. Despite the situation having nothing to do with her porn life, her Twitter followers were with her all the way, tweeting congratulations and piping in with suggestions for names. She ultimately settled on the name Maya.\n",
      "Although many of her tweets are on her hobbies, Kross says that Twitter has been the key to her success in the porn world.\n",

      "The home state of the father of Indian independence, Mahatma Gandhi, forbade the sale and circulation of a new book it says spews revisionist history about the birth of secular but predominantly Hindu India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n",
      "Written by Jaswant Singh, a former federal minister and senior member of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the book calls Mohammed Ali Jinnah, considered by Indians the architect of the partition, a great man who is wrongly demonized.

      "\"This flashpoint played out in public is a reminder of those wounds,\" Tejpal said of the book dispute.\n",
      "As a book of history written by a politician, it might have been inconsequential, Tejpal said. But as a book about the partition, it was incendiary.\n",
      "\"What happened 62 years ago continues to haunt us in a very bitter way,\" Tejpal said. \"We can't seem to leave our baggage in the past.\"\n",
      "This isn't the first time that Pakistan's founder has caused trouble for a Hindu nationalist. BJP President Lal Krishna Advani was forced to temporarily step down in 2005 for praising Jinnah's secularism during a trip to Pakistan.\n",
      "Political observers say the Singh controversy reflects a battle for the soul of the BJP, beleaguered by electoral defeats and vicious infighting.\n",
      "Many in India view the BJP as a divisive force attempting to gain power by exploiting Hindu-Muslim tensions. Advani was charged in the 1992 demolition of the 16th-century Babri mosque in the central Indian city of Ayodhya, though he was later acquitted in that case.\n",
      "Journalist K.G. Suresh, a longtime observer of conservative politics in India, said the BJP is struggling to figure out how to stay electable, whether to move right or stay closer to the center.\n",

      "Like many New Yorkers, I remember a time when nearly everyone smoked. In 1950, Collier's reported that more than three-quarters of adult men smoked. This epidemic had a devastating and long-lasting impact on public health.\n",
      "Today, we find ourselves in the midst of a new public health epidemic: childhood obesity.\n",
      "What smoking was to my parents' generation, obesity is to my children's generation. Nearly one out of every four New Yorkers under the age of 18 is obese. In many high-poverty areas, the rate is closer to one out of three.\n",
      "That is why, in the state budget I presented last Tuesday, I proposed a tax on sugared beverages like soda. Research has demonstrated that soft-drink consumption is one of the main drivers of childhood obesity.\n",
      "For example, a study by Harvard researchers found that each additional 12-ounce soft drink consumed per day increases the risk of a child becoming obese by 60 percent. For adults, the association is similar.\n",
      "If we are to succeed in reducing childhood obesity, we must reduce consumption of sugared beverages. That is the purpose of our proposed tax. We estimate that an 18 percent tax will reduce consumption by five percent.\n",
      "Our tax would apply only to sugared drinks -- including fruit drinks that are less than 70 percent juice -- that are nondiet. The $404 million this tax would raise next year will go toward funding public health programs, including obesity prevention programs, across New York state.\n",
      "The surgeon general estimates that obesity was associated with 112,000 deaths in the United States every year. Here in New York state, we spend almost $6.1 billion on health care related to adult obesity -- the second-highest level of spending in the nation.\n",
      "Last year, legitimate concerns about links between consumption of fast food and the prevalence of heart disease prompted New York City to ban the use of trans fats in restaurant food.\n",
      "No one can deny the urgency of reducing the rate of obesity, including childhood obesity. Obesity causes serious health problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. It puts children at much greater risk for life-threatening conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n",
      "We must never stigmatize children who are overweight or obese. Yet, for the sake of our children's health, we have an obligation to address this crisis. I believe we can ultimately curb the obesity epidemic the same way we curbed smoking: through smart public policy.\n",
      "In recent decades, anti-smoking campaigns have raised awareness. Smoking bans have been enacted and enforced. And, perhaps most importantly, we have raised the price of cigarettes.\n",
      "In June, New York state raised the state cigarette tax an additional $1.25. According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, this increase alone will prevent more than 243,000 kids from smoking, save more than 37,000 lives and produce more than $5 billion in health care savings.\n",

      "Roy Pickler lay on the floor, dripping with sweat, as trainer Bob Harper quipped, \"You look like you got run over by a reindeer.\"\n",
      "Pickler's job as a professional Santa was a constant joke on the latest season of \"The Biggest Loser.\" With his long white beard and protruding stomach, the 63-year-old looked every bit the part he played.\n",
      "By the time he was voted off the show, Pickler had lost 88 pounds. During his elimination interview, he donned a Santa hat and told viewers his toned physique wouldn't stop him from bringing Christmas joy to children.\n",
      "\"The world is going to have to change their acceptance of what Santa looks like,\" Pickler said. \"Santa is a role model, and kids don't want to have a role model that's fat.\"\n",
      "Since 1980, obesity rates among children and adolescents have almost tripled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 12.5 million children age 2 to 19 are obese; that extra weight can lead to serious health problems, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and psychosocial issues such as peer discrimination or poor self-esteem.\n",
      "The epidemic has gotten a lot of attention in the past few years. Everyone from first lady Michelle Obama to Shaquille O'Neal is trying to figure out the best way to inspire kids to get and stay fit.\n",
      "Children learn healthy (or unhealthy) habits from those they admire. And Santa is one of the most recognizable figures in America.\n",
      "For at least a month every year, he appears on billboards, storefronts and TV commercials. Millions of kids stand in line to sit on his comfortably padded lap and whisper secrets in his ear. They write letters to him, sing songs about him and read stories about him.\n",
      "Photos: Santa over the years\n",
      "We worry about the effect fast-food advertisements have on students in school. With all his free publicity, should Santa still be fat?\n",
      "\"Let's put it this way,\" registered dietician Beth Kitchin said with a laugh. \"I don't think Santa should be skinny.\"\n",
      "There are a lot of other markers to consider in measuring health. Research shows that people can have a higher body mass index and still be healthy, Kitchin said. One can assume Santa is pretty active, wrangling hundreds of elves and nine reindeer every year. And his cheery disposition says a lot about his stress level, which could relate to low blood pressure.\n",
      "Of course, Santa does have a penchant for sugary treats. One fan estimated the big man eats more than 5,000 tons of cookies on Christmas Eve alone. If Santa isn't diabetic, Christmas magic really does exist.\n",
      "A 2009 study published in the British Medical Journal determined that Santa could very well be a \"public health pariah.\" The light-hearted research by Nathan Grills of Monash University in Australia found a correlation between countries that recognize Santa and a high rate of childhood obesity.\n",
      "Santa's weight is a longstanding tradition, said Tom Kliner, founder of Santas Across the Globe and the Fraternity of International Real Bearded Santas. The character originated with St. Nicholas, who lived in Turkey during the fourth century. Nicholas was a wealthy young bishop who started giving away all his gold after his parents died.\n",
      "\"Back in those days, extra weight was a sign of wealth and affluence,\" Kliner said.\n",
      "Hollywood used to have a set of numbers -- waist circumference, face shape, beard length -- that Santas were supposed to adhere to, Kliner said. But around the world, the legendary giver comes in all shapes and sizes. Coca-Cola's Santa, whom many in America try to emulate, is very round: round face, round nose, round stomach. The Santa imitated in Europe is a thinner man with more squared-off features.\n",
      "Kliner said he sees Santa as more of a public figure than a role model. \"I've never seen anybody aspire to become Santa Claus.\"\n",
      "Changing Santa's iconic image would be hard, said Meg Cox, author of \"The Book of New Family Traditions.\" Comfort and security come with seeing the same character year after year.\n",
      "\"We carry these traditions forward from our childhood,\" she said. \"Some of us are pretty emotional about them. And yet I think there's nothing wrong with having a sense of play about it.\"\n",
      "If you want Santa to be skinny, Cox said, make it happen: Tell your kids Santa is tired of eating cookies, and leave an apple out instead.\n",
      "\"Having your own take on Santa might be the ultimate personalized Christmas.\"\n",
      "It's possible our culture is already changing. Santa races are becoming as much of a tradition as candy canes and Christmas lights. Kids are finding active video games under the tree alongside step counters and organic cookbooks for Mom or Dad.\n",
      "10 healthy gifts that keep giving\n",
      "Pickler recently called a couple of companies he has contracts with and asked whether they were OK with a trim Santa.\n",
      "\"They both said, 'We want you just the way you are. Your idea of a healthy Santa is the one we want to go with.' \"\n",
      "Since \"The Biggest Loser\" finale, Pickler and his wife, Chris, have spoken to kids across the Midwest about nutrition and exercise. Pickler often walks in to schools dressed as Santa Claus and then takes off his suit, Superman-style, to reveal his new fit self.\n",
      "In an upcoming documentary about Santas titled \"They Wore a Red Suit,\" Pickler implores his colleagues around the country to get fit.\n",
      "\"We cannot use (our role) as an excuse, because it influences kids in the wrong direction,\" he said.\n",
      "Maybe one day, instead of a belly that shakes like a bowl full of jelly, Santa will have a six-pack. Maybe his cheeks will glow not from the cold but because he's consuming the recommended doses of omega-3 fatty acids. Maybe Mrs. Claus will take up gardening. (Granted, that would be hard to do at the North Pole, but surely the elves can build a greenhouse or two.)\n",
      "Eventually, in addition to being a role model for the Christmas spirit, our beloved St. Nick could become a healthy role model for kids.\n",

      "Federal prosecutors accuse Korean-born researcher Dr. Dong Pyou-Han of deliberately falsifying key blood research into a possible vaccine for HIV.\n",
      "An indictment brought against Han says he falsely showed that rabbits infected with the virus had shown remarkable improvement. That improvement was so advanced that the government's National Institutes of Health awarded Iowa State and Han nearly $15 million in federal research grants.\n",
      "Prosecutors say the false results actually cleared a first level of back-up testing but fell apart after Han's boss at Iowa State began to get suspicious.\n",
      "According to the criminal complaint, the false results were secretly given to the NIH as well as a senior scientist at Iowa State after the first publication of the scientific paper. It was then, according to the complaint, that they discovered the rabbit blood was spiked with human antibodies, making it appear the rabbits were developing an immunity to the virus.\n",
      "A spokesman for Iowa State University, John McCaroll, told CNN that the school's reaction was \"disbelief, surprise, shock, disappointment.\"\n",

      "As for the roughly $15 million in federal research grants handed out to Han and Iowa State, most of it is gone, spent on salaries and lab gear, the spokesman said. The school did repay about $500,000.\n",
      "According to Retraction Watch, a group that tracks research fraud, scientists who fake research rarely go to prison and hardly ever are forced to pay taxpayers back for misused grants.\n",
      "In all, says a prominent scientist, the NIH has given about $58 million in funds to science that turned out to be phony over the past 22 years. Dr. Ferric Fang, a scientist at the University of Washington, added up the numbers but cautioned the real number may be even higher.\n",
      "As for Han, there was no answer at a Cleveland apartment building where he was believed to be staying until the trial. CNN did reach him on his cell phone, and when asked what happened, time and again he said only two words: \"I'm sorry.\"\n",

      "The men first ordered Ken Cordier to strip naked.\n",
      "A poll has sparked debate among Christians about torture.\n",
      "They then forced him face-down to the ground and pinned his arms and legs. One of them grabbed a fan belt from a truck and began flogging Cordier. When it was over, they returned another day with a new approach. They slung a rope around Cordier's neck, pulled him back like a bow and beat him with their fists.\n",
      "\"You could tell they enjoyed it,\" Cordier says. \"They had that look in their eyes and they grinned.\"\n",
      "This is how Cordier described being tortured. He is a former U.S. Air Force pilot who was captured by the North Vietnamese in 1966. Though he was tortured for six years in captivity, Cordier says he survived because \"I never gave up faith in God and country\"\n",
      "But what happens when faith in God and country seem to collide? What happens when people like Cordier, who rely on their faith in God and their flag, are asked if they would support torture against suspected terrorists?\n",
      "Cordier says he would never support torture, but his views would make him a minority among a certain segment of Christians, according to a provocative survey.\n",
      "A survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that white evangelical Christians are more likely to support torture than people who rarely or never attend religious services.\n",
      "The survey said that 62 percent of white evangelical Protestants say that the use of  torture against suspected terrorists can be often or sometimes justified in order to gain important information.\n",
      "When asked the same question, 40 percent of the \"religiously unaffiliated\" say torture can be often or sometimes justified. The survey, however, did not define torture or say whether \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" like waterboarding are torture.\n",
      "The survey comes at a time when the debate over torture is intensifying after the Obama administration released Bush-era memos that gave legal justification to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as waterboarding.\n",
      "The survey's results have also sparked a debate within the Christian community that revolves around one question: How can a Christian support torture?\n",
      "When evangelicals say torture is permitted\n",
      "They can't -- except in extreme circumstances, some evangelicals say.\n",
      "Rev. Ronald Kuykendall, an evangelical pastor in Gainesville, Florida, says that the question is difficult to answer because everyone has a different definition of torture. He says he would support the torture of a terrorist if \"the techniques used are lawful, necessary\" and the ultimate purpose is to save lives.\n",
      "Kuykendall says the New Testament (Romans 13:1-7) teaches Christians that \"everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.\"\n",
      "\"The NT [New Testament] is clear that God grants the right of the 'sword' to the state to be used against wrongdoers,\" Kuykendall says. \"Just as I believe I don't have a right to vengeance personally, I do believe that I can seek justice through the state and call the police on a robber, or a gunman threatening my life.\"\n",
      "Chuck Colson, the evangelical pastor who once served as an aide to President Nixon, answered the same question in an online discussion conducted by the Washington Post \"On Faith\" Web site.\n",
      "Colson said that Christians are supposed to obey the law, but there may be times when there is a higher obligation, such as ignoring a \"no trespassing\" sign to rescue a drowning man.\n",
      "\"So it is with torture,\" Colson wrote. \"If a competent authority honestly believes that this was the only way to get information that might save the lives of thousands, I believe he would be justified.\"\n",
      "Charles Kammer, a religious studies professor, says he was not surprised to learn that a majority of evangelical Christians support the use of torture in certain circumstances.\n",
      "Kammer says that despite Jesus' own commitment to nonviolence, Christianity as a whole has never embraced nonviolence. He says some evangelicals also confuse patriotism with piety.\n",
      "\"What's good for America has often been seen as God's will,\" says Kammer, who teaches at The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio.\n",
      "\"They think the torture of evil people is not bad, but may be morally required as a way of protecting the good people.\"\n",
      "Kammer said he is a Christian and does not support torture in any circumstances. He considers waterboarding torture.\n",
      "\"If we're ever going to provide any moral leadership in the world,\" he says, \"we have to live in the world in a particular way. We can't criticize our enemies for doing what we're doing.\"\n",
      "What Vietnam POWs who are Christians think of torture\n",
      "The debate over the uses of torture among people of faith doesn't end with its practice. It also extends to its definition.\n",
      "The Geneva Conventions say that \"no physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war.\" The U.N. Convention Against Torture defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering, \"whether physical or mental,\" is inflicted on a person.\n",
      "Cordier, the Vietnam POW, opposes torture in all circumstances -- even the \"ticking bomb\" scenario.\n",
      "\"Once you're in a pain situation, you'll say anything to get it to stop,\" Cordier says. \"It's not as reliable as more sophisticated methods.\"\n",
      "But he doesn't consider waterboarding and other \"enhanced techniques\" torture.\n",
      "\"Loud music, sleep deprivation, waterboarding -- does it leave permanent damage and cause extreme pain? No,\" Cordier says.\n",
      "The Rev. Robert G. Certain, another Vietnam vet who is now an Episcopal priest, says waterboarding isn't torture because \"it doesn't cause grave, bodily harm.\" See CIA interrogation methods authorized during the Bush-era »\n",
      "Certain was captured by the Vietnamese in 1972 after his B-52 bomber was shot down. He wrote about his experiences in the book, \"Unchained Eagle.\"\n",
      "Certain says his faith teaches him to oppose torture under all circumstances. His military background, however, tells him that it can be easy for interrogators to cross the line.\n",
      "\"To use torture is morally impermissible,\" Certain says. \"But when we place somebody in uniform into a place of moral ambiguity, there are likely to be times when their judgment is going to step across into the morally impermissible. They're living in a fog. It's not black and white.\"\n",
      "Certain remembers how easily his Vietnamese captors justified crossing the line with him. They said American prisoners weren't covered by the Geneva Conventions.\n",
      "\"They said we were not prisoners of war because there was no legal declaration of war,\" Certain says. \"Therefore we were air pirates and they could treat us any way they felt.\"\n",
      "Cordier, the Air Force pilot who was tortured, says he still relies on his faith in God and country. He's active in POW affairs and reunions. And he recently took a trip to the Holy Land to see where Jesus lived and died.\n",
      "When he read about the torture and execution of Jesus in the Bible, he read it in a different way because of his POW experiences.\n",
      "\"I appreciated his stripes when I got my own,\" Cordier says.\n",
      "Cordier gained some notoriety during the 2004 presidential campaign when he participated in the swift boat ads against then-Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.\n",
      "Cordier says some of his fellow prisoners lost their faith in God because of torture, but he didn't.\n",

      "(CNN)When I received an advance copy of a book called \"Moody Bitches\" last month, I was immediately intrigued.\n",
      "I have been called moody, and the \"b\" word, but never have both terms been used -- at once -- to describe me. (At least not that I know of!)\n",
      "Had I been labeled a moody \"b\" in the past, I certainly would have taken it as a major insult.\n",
      "But today, if someone called me that, I think I would say, \"Thank you for describing who I am and who we, women, are. There is nothing wrong with being moody, emotional or irritable.\"\n",
      "That provocative title, \"Moody Bitches: The Truth About the Drugs You're Taking, the Sleep You're Missing, the Sex You're Not Having and What's Really Making You Crazy,\" got me thinking about whether our emotionality, our monthly ups and downs during our menstrual cycle, should be viewed as such a negative after all.\n",
      "Opinion: Are drugs stifling women?\n",
      "\"Women have this idea that we are supposed to not be moody and we're supposed to tamp down that moodiness,\" said Julie Holland, author of \"Moody Bitches\" and a psychiatrist who has practiced in New York for 20 years.\n",
      "\"It's like a problem to be fixed and really, I think it's our greatest asset. It's certainly our greatest psychological asset.\"\n",
      "After all, our empathetic nature helps us understand nonverbal babies -- and not-always-the-most-communicative husbands and partners. Our intuition helps us sense people's motivations. Our emotions help us realize when something is wrong in our lives.\n",
      "So, why on earth have all of those qualities come to be viewed as a source of weakness, not strength? And why is at least one in four American women taking some form of psychiatric medication, including antidepressants, versus one in seven men, according to Holland?\n",
      "Some of these women definitely should be taking antidepressants and other medications, but the question is why are so many other women taking them when they don't need to be?\n",
      "This is you on stress?\n",
      "Those were just some of the many questions a group of us chatted about over coffee recently: Holland, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin, Cosmopolitan executive editor Leslie Yazel and me.\n",
      "Yazel, a mom of a 4-year-old, wondered if people are afraid of being unhappy.\n",
      "\"I do think that people are afraid to be sad and they're afraid to be scared,\" Holland said.\n",
      "\"I think we spend a lot of time and energy pushing down emotions that are uncomfortable for us. I don't want to cry right now. I don't want to be angry. I don't want to be scared so we push it down, but the problem with pushing it down is it takes a lot of energy and it ends up creating a lot of tension.\"\n",
      "Social media, with the endless barrage of gorgeous-looking pictures from family and friends who appear to be having the most perfect lives, certainly doesn't help. In fact, a recent study showed that heavy Facebook users experience envy, which could lead to extreme sadness and depression.\n",
      "\"Everyone's Instagraming their best, most fabulous, freakin' pictures, and they're looking so skinny and beautiful and so happy, and they're going on vacation ... and then you compare it to your life,\" said Hostin, a mom of two.\n",
      "It's not a real or genuine life, Holland said. \"It's plastic.\"\n",
      "But when more and more women medicate away their emotions when they don't need to be taking antidepressants or any other psychiatric drugs, they create a \"new normal,\" she said.\n",
      "Postpartum depression: One mom's mission becomes a movement\n",
      "\"It's like doping and biking, or steroids and baseball. If everybody is doing it, then the ones who don't are at a disadvantage,\" said Holland, who is also the author of the best-selling memoir \"Weekends at Bellevue.\"\n",
      "\"If everyone is getting boob jobs, then people who don't end up feeling flat-chested.\"\n",
      "And when it seems more normal than not to be on mental health meds, the bar is lowered for when women will go on antidepressants, she said.\n",
      "Women who are medicating away their emotions when they don't need to be might not realize there are major effects to their decision. Notably, they find it more difficult to cry -- and tougher to orgasm.\n",
      "\"I certainly talk to my patients about sexual side effects. It comes up all the time. In our first meeting, I ask ... 'Is it hard for you to climax because this may end up being an issue? It's going to be even harder' ... but it's not like it's in the advertising,\" Holland said.\n",
      "\"It may be in the small print on the back of the ad, or they may say it at lightning speed during the TV commercial.\"\n",
      "Women today are subjected to a barrage of advertising -- from daytime talk shows to women's magazines -- about the medications they could take to make them feel better.\n",
      "Women's desire for sex is complicated, not strictly hormonal, study says\n",
      "\"Twenty years ago, when I started my practice, I had somebody come to me and they would have symptoms, but they didn't quite know what was wrong and what they needed. And now people come to me and it's like, 'Well can you explain the difference between Effexor and Wellbutrin, and can you tell me which one I should take?' \"\n",
      "The conversation \"advanced from 'Is there something wrong with me? Do I need medicine?' to 'Which medicine is right for me?' \" said Holland, who points to how nine out of 10 of the big pharmaceutical companies spend more on marketing than on research and development.\n",
      "What we're also seeing, Holland said, is a growing belief by women in the workplace that they need the meds to control their emotions at the office.\n",
      "She tells the story of a woman who called her up in tears and said she needed new antidepressants because clearly her current meds weren't preventing her from crying at work.\n",
      "When Holland asked her what caused her to cry, she said her boss was being difficult. Holland said what was needed was a plan to confront her boss, not a prescription for a new medication.\n",
      "\"I hate to see us medicating away our sensitivity and emotionality for the comfort of other people in the workplace. I think it's a big mistake.\"\n",
      "Thinking about trying to control our emotionality for the comfort of others reminded me of a college relationship, which I shared with Hostin, Yazel and Holland.\n",
      "My boyfriend at the time told me one of my problems (he clearly thought I had many!) was that my highs were too high and my lows were too low.\n",
      "He said I needed to live in the middle. \"You should be more like me, like a man,\" joked Holland.\n",
      "Clearly, that relationship didn't last very long!\n",
      "As we wrapped up, I asked the women what the biggest takeaway was for them following our conversation about Holland's thoughtful new book.\n",
      "\"Don't give up your awesome orgasms,\" said Yazel. (Amen to that!)\n",
      "\"So it's OK to be a moody 'b'?' \" Hostin asked.\n",
      "\"It's OK to be a moody 'b,' \" Holland replied.\n",
      "\"Our sensitivity and our emotionality is an asset. It's not a liability. It's not a symptom that needs to be medicated away.\"\n",

      "Derek Boos sifts through the wreckage of his in-laws' house Friday after a fire in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n",

      "The fire began Saturday and rekindled itself Wednesday evening, according to the Forestry Commission.\n",

      "\"It's better now, but the smoke was pretty much everywhere,\" said Chavdar Pavlov, a CNN iReport contributor who lives 20 miles from where the fires raged. \"At nighttime, it was like snow in the air, but it wasn't snow; it was ashes.\"\n",

      "In an editorial, the paper adds: \"British forces should be very proud today as a liberated Libya celebrates the death\" of Gadhafi. \"Our brilliant troops spearheaded the operation to end the dictator's tyranny.\n",
      "\"Revenge is sweet. The architect of Lockerbie, who supplied the IRA with bombs and had London WPC (policewoman) Yvonne Fletcher murdered, died like a rat after being cornered in a drain.\n",
      "\"Six months after the killing of Osama bin Laden, the world is rid of another madman.\"\n",
      "Even the left-leaning Guardian recognizes the success of NATO's military campaign in Libya. \"After all the waiting, the killings and the tears, the wheel of history turned inexorably, and all who watched knew it would never turn back,\" wrote the paper's Simon Tisdall. \"The Arab Spring had claimed another infamous scalp. The risky western intervention had worked. And Libya was liberated at last.\"\n",
      "France's Le Figaro reports the events of Thursday as \"Mission Accomplished\" for NATO after a seven-month-long campaign which has seen 26,000 sorties flown over Libya.\n",
      "But it warns that Libya's new leaders, the National Transitional Council, must do all they can to avoid the country falling into the same state of chaos and anarchy which hit Iraq in 2003 after the fall of Saddam Hussein.\n",
      "\"The National Transitional Council has an obligation to put an end to the ragtag bands of rebels, to protect those Libyan residents with darker skin than others, to forbid any wild behavior; in short it must ensure the spirit of justice and reconciliation prevails over that of revenge.\"\n",
      "In Germany, Die Welt ponders the question of how exactly Gadhafi's end came about, reporting on the conflicting information about his capture and subsequent killing, and questioning whether he died \"in the crossfire or at the hands of a lynch mob.\"\n",
      "The Berlin-based daily reports on the bizarre combination of character traits that made up the \"poet and butcher\" Gadhafi, reporting that with his death, \"the world has one less mass murderer and brutally inhuman dictator, but also one less paranoid 'bird of paradise.'\"\n",
      "The Financial Times also hints at a sense of unease over the killing, commenting in an op-ed that \"it might perhaps have been better\" if Gadhafi had been captured alive and put on trial. However it added that his death \"has the merit of depriving the remnants of the old regime of a figurehead to rally round.\"\n",
      "The European edition of the Wall Street Journal reflects on what the Western intervention in Libya shows us about the contenders for the White House in next year's presidential election. \"Mr. Obama's decision to keep a political low profile during the war -- to 'lead from behind' -- hurt the cause. NATO was left without a political general, and at times it wobbled. The U.S. was too late to recognize the Benghazi government, and Mr. Obama's calculated reticence invited a backlash in Congress over war powers.\n",
      "\"Yet the president was a statesman compared with some GOP pretenders to the commander-in-chief's chair. Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and Newt Gingrich opposed U.S. participation as a high-risk intervention, a claim that now looks strategically mistaken and politically opportunistic. John McCain, a Republican who never wavered on Libya, yesterday offered adult advice for the U.S. now 'to deepen our support' for Libya's coming move from dictatorship to something new.\"\n",
      "It concluded by saying the world's sole superpower \"can still shape events for the better.\"\n",
      "\"Libya's successful revolution is the latest proof that liberating the world of a dictator can serve America's strategic interests and its moral principles.\"\n",
      "In Britain's Independent newspaper, Robert Fisk, who met Gadhafi 30 years ago, recalls how the former Libyan strongman was alternately feted, then demonized by the West -- often with confusing haste. \"We loved him. We hated him. Then we loved him again. Blair slobbered over him. Then we hated him again. Then La Clinton slobbered over her BlackBerry and we really hated him even more again. Let us all pray that he wasn't murdered. 'Died of wounds suffered during capture.' What did that mean?\n",
      "\"He was a crazy combination of Don Corleone and Donald Duck ... and we who had to watch his ridiculous march-pasts and his speeches bit our lips and wrote about Libyan tanks and marines and missiles that were supposed to take this nonsense seriously. His frogmen flipped and flapped through Green Square in the heat and we had to take this rubbish at face value and pretend that it was a real threat to Israel; just as Blair tried to persuade us (not unsuccessfully) that (Gadhafi's) pathetic attempts to create 'weapons of mass destruction' had been skewered. This, in a country that couldn't repair a public lavatory.\"\n",
      "Finally across the Atlantic, another of Rupert Murdoch's tabloids, the New York Post managed to produce one of the most bizarre front pages on Gadhafi. Alongside a photo of one of Gadhafi's alleged captors wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap, the paper got in a cheeky critique of star player Alex Rodriguez's recent performances, with the sub-headline: \"Gunman had more hits than A-Rod.\"\n",

      "In an effort to understand why a truck serving as a parade float crossed in front of a fast-moving locomotive last week, killing four war veterans on the float, federal accident investigators on Tuesday will re-create the accident conditions.\n",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will stage a locomotive and a truck at the railroad crossing in Midland, Texas, to measure the sight distances between the two. The test will answer the question: \"What could be seen, when, (and) where?\" board member Mark Rosekind said.\n",
      "The test comes as investigators this week examine a wealth of information about the crash, including several videos that captured the moments leading up to impact. They also are reviewing interviews with the train's engineer and conductor and are making plans to interview the truck driver.\n",
      "The accident happened late Thursday afternoon during the \"Hunt for Heroes\" parade to honor members of the U.S. military. The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing the tracks when an eastbound Union Pacific train slammed into it, Midland police said.\n",
      "The safety board said the grade crossing warning system -- consisting of a bell, lights and a gate -- operated as designed, giving a 20-second warning of the train's arrival. But the truck entered the crossing, and the gate lowered, tipping over flag stands on the float, safety board investigators said.\n",
      "Some people were able to jump off the truck in time, witnesses said.\n",
      "But first responders found two dead at the scene, and two others were later pronounced dead at Midland Memorial Hospital. Fifteen others were injured, some seriously.\n",
      "Those killed were identified as Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer, 37, Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin, 47, Army Sgt. Joshua Michael, 34, and Army Sgt. Maj. William Lubbers, 43.\n",
      "The safety board did not speculate or hint at the cause of the crash, but instead cited a number of facts that appeared not to be factors. The train was traveling 62 mph, the safety board said, under the 70 mph speed limit.\n",
      "No anomalies have been found in the grade crossing warning system, Rosekind said. Nor have investigators found any mechanical problem with the train's air brakes, nor defects with the tracks, Rosekind said.\n",
      "Rosekind said the south traffic light at the grade crossing turned green 21 seconds before the train's arrival at the crossing, as designed, to allow traffic time to clear the crossing. At 20 seconds before the collision, the bells and lights on the mast activated, in keeping with the minimum time under federal law.\n",
      "At 13 seconds before the collision, the gate started coming down, and a second later, the front of the truck crossed the north rail of the tracks.\n",
      "The engineer sounded the horn nine seconds before impact. At seven seconds before impact, the lowering gate struck flagpoles on the float.\n",
      "The train's emergency brakes were applied five seconds before impact, but it took the train 75 seconds to come to a complete stop, Rosekind said.\n",
      "Rosekind said investigators would remain on the scene through much of this week and said a conclusion to their work is months away.\n",
      "Investigators are reviewing video from a forward-facing camera on the locomotive, and video from a dashboard camera on a police cruiser that was behind the parade float, Rosekind said. They are also examining information on a data event recorder on the train, which recorded the train's speed, horn, etc.\n",
      "The grade crossing where the accident occurred had been designated a \"quiet zone.\" Typically, trains blast their horns a quarter mile before a crossing. But the city of Midland applied to designate the crossing a quiet zone.\n",
      "Rosekind said alternative safety measures are provided in quiet zones. \"Our investigators will now be looking at exactly what those safety measures were and whether they were in place at the time of the accident,\" he said.\n",
      "The safety board will also be looking at the parade permits to see what conditions were placed on the parade and whether those conditions were met.\n",

      "California's vote on a controversial cigarette tax remained too close to call Wednesday morning, although votes counted so far suggest it was narrowly rejected.\n",
      "With all precincts reporting, the tally was 50.8% against the proposal and 49.2% in support of it, according to the California Secretary of State website.\n",

      "Counties have 28 days to count every vote-by-mail, provisional and damaged ballot, the secretary of state's office said.\n",
      "With nearly 3.9 million votes cast in precincts, the \"no\" votes were ahead by only about 63,000.\n",
      "Proposition 29, would raise about $735 million a year. About three-quarters of the money raised would go to cancer research.\n",
      "\"The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association wrote the initiative carefully,\" Lori Bremner of the American Cancer Society told CNN's \"Sanjay Gupta MD\" last week.\n",

      "Studies show the tax would help decrease smoking and save lives, she said.\n",
      "Opponents slammed the tax as a misguided burden in an already tough economy.\n",
      "\"What we're seeing in the state of California is a lot of frustration on the part of our citizenry that it's just another tax,\" said Dr. Marcy Zwelling, a general practitioner. The tax, she said in an interview with CNN, \"goes to build bigger bureaucracy, build business, build buildings, not necessarily to go to cancer research.\"\n",
      "The opposition in California was fueled by a huge influx of cash from big tobacco companies. About $47 million was raised in efforts -- including TV advertising -- to defeat \"Prop. 29,\" including $27.5 million from Philip Morris and $11 million from R.J. Reynolds, according to figures from MapLight, a nonpartisan research firm.\n",
      "About $12 million was raised in support of the initiative, including $8.5 million from the American Cancer Society and $1.5 million from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, known as Livestrong. Armstrong himself appeared in ads urging people to \"vote yes on 29.\" (Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, is a board member of the foundation.)\n",
      "There is already an 87-cent tax on each pack of cigarettes in California.\n",

      "Bremner insisted the campaign against Prop. 29 traded in \"deceptions.\" The biggest misconception is that the money collected \"will be somehow wasted or used otherwise,\" she said.\n",

      "\"You see a little more than 1% of the mine on the tourist route,\" said Marek Strojny, a guide for more than 20 years.\n",
      "Consider that the tourist route is three kilometers (1.8 miles) long and takes three hours to explore.\n",
      "\"It would take years to see all of the mine,\" said Strojny.\n",
      "\"There are nine levels, with 300 kilometers (186 miles) of tunnels and more than 3,000 chambers.\"\n",
      "Tourists view the mine at just over 300 feet (91 meters) below the surface, but its intricacies continue down for more than double that depth.\n",
      "Mining here was dangerous work; there were cave-ins, and occasional methane explosions. This accounts for why the miners built the chapel in the 14th century -- they prayed constantly for their safety, and carved religious figures in their spare time. (Strojny estimated \"The Last Supper\" alone would have taken a year to complete.)\n",
      "However, the job came with its perks.\n",
      "\"There was great respect for the miners among the community on the surface,\" he noted.\n",

      "The salt would doubtless have been traded at Krakow's Rynek Glowny, the largest medieval market square in Europe and the site of another intriguing underground voyage.\n",

In the 14th and 15th centuries it was a major center of European trade, abuzz with merchants selling everything from luxury goods (such as silks and spices) to cloth and lead.\n",

      "Samuel Levin, responding to a lawsuit Cage filed against him, said he warned the Oscar-winning actor that he could face bankruptcy unless he scaled back his lavish lifestyle.\n",
      "Cage, one of Hollywood's highest-paid movie stars, sued Levin in October, charging that he \"lined his pockets with several million dollars in business management fees while sending Cage down a path toward financial ruin.\"\n",
      "\"Cage discovered that he is now forced to sell major assets and investments at a significant loss and is faced with huge tax liabilities because of Levin's incompetence, misrepresentations and recklessness,\" Cage's lawsuit said. He asked the Los Angeles Superior Court for $20 million in damages from Levin.\n",
      "Levin filed a counter-complaint this week demanding $129,000 owed to him by Cage for recent work on his tax returns. The filing also argued that Cage was \"deeply in debt\" when he started working for him in 2001 because Cage had \"already squandered tens of millions of dollars he had earned as a movie star.\"\n",
      "Levin said he warned Cage, whose given name is Nicolas Coppola, that he needed to earn $30 million a year \"just to maintain his lavish lifestyle.\" He urged Cage to save \"a cash cushion\" of at least $10 million \"to alleviate the financial pressure to take film roles that might be detrimental to his career,\" Levin's response said.\n",
      "Several of Cage's recent movie roles have been seen by critics as \"paycheck gigs\" taken only because of his pressing debt.\n",
      "Levin's filing claimed that starting in 2005 and then \"with increasing urgency\" over the next two years, he \"implored Coppola to stop buying real estate and urged him to reduce his real estate holdings, warning Coppola that the financial press was filled with references to a 'real estate bubble.' \"\n",
      "He countered Cage's claim that the actor was left in the dark about his finances.\n",
      "\"Levin repeatedly warned Coppola that he was living beyond his means, urged him to spend less, and warned him that financial disaster loomed if he continued to spend uncontrollably,\" Levin's filing said.\n",
      "\"Levin described the folly of several other well-known entertainers who compulsively overspent their way into bankruptcy, and warned Coppola 'it could happen to you,' \" the filing said.\n",
      "Cage should have known about his debt because \"he signed every check for every monetary transaction throughout the relationship,\" Levin said.\n",
      "\"Instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Coppola spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences, most of which were bought against Levin's advice,\" Levin's complaint said. \"Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art.\"\n",
      "Cage's four yachts included one each for the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Newport Beach, California, and Rhode Island, Levin said.\n",
      "In 2007 alone, Cage's \"shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items,\" Levin's filing said.\n",
      "\"Coppola also spent huge sums taking his sizable entourage on costly vacations and threw enormous, Gatsby-style parties at his residences,\" it said.\n",
      "Levin's warnings that Cage was living beyond his means were not just ignored, but \"at times Levin was rebuked for trying to restrain the outflow of cash,\" he said.\n",
      "\"The pinnacle\" of Cage's spending spree was the purchase of two castles -- in England and Germany -- which Levin warned \"were decrepit and needed huge expenditures,\" he said.\n",
      "Cage's financial collapse came in 2008 when real estate values plunged and most of his residences turned \"upside down, just as the global credit crunch made it impossible to cover Coppola's endless cash calls by borrowing more money,\" Levin said.\n",
      "The case of Nicolas Cage versus Samuel Levin is set for a hearing in a Beverly Hills, California, courtroom on February 3, 2010, according to court records.\n",

      "The rallies are over, the students have been sent home and the people of Tehran braved searing heat and impenetrable traffic to select a new president Friday from a field of six candidates.\n",
      "Despite the assertion by some residents here that it doesn't matter who wins -- all of the candidates have been vetted by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and are likely to continue the anti-Western policies that have formed his world view since he came to power in 1989 -- a feeling of excitement has been notable here.\n",
      "Part of the sense of excitement may have nothing to do with politics -- instead, it could be because many residents began their weekend at noon Thursday. The bazaars visited by CNN were thronged with people.\n",
      "But that wouldn't explain the presence in recent days of thousands of people -- some of them lured by sweets handed out by organizers -- at rallies for the various candidates. Many of them expressed their views, including complaints, to CNN reporters as government security agents hovered nearby.\n",
      "What's at stake in Iran's presidential election?\n",
      "At a rally for Saeed Jalili, a hard-line candidate and the nation's chief nuclear negotiator, men and women attended in separate groups, the women's heads and bodies covered by the loose robe favored by some Muslims.\n",
      "\"Death to America! Death to Israel!\" chanted the crowd when Jalili spoke of a nuclear scientist who had been killed.\n",
      "But the sentiment appeared more political than personal. Afterward, approached by a reporter they recognized to be from the United States, many of the participants appeared welcoming and eager to talk.\n",
      "\"I don't have a problem with the people of the United States,\" said one person. \"But I have a problem with people who trample on our inalienable rights to nuclear power.\"\n",
      "The unifying impact of Iran's nuclear program is hard to underestimate: a nuclear symbol appears on the ubiquitous 50,000 rial note, which is worth about $1.50, and many here say that it's their country's right to pursue a nuclear program.\n",

      "Though thousands of fliers supporting various candidates littered rally sites on Wednesday, nearly all of the election signs had been taken down on Thursday -- in compliance with the law ordering an end to electioneering a day before the nation's 66,000 polling stations open.\n",
      "A few posters extolling the candidacy of the popular mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Ghalibaf, remained affixed to walls in the capital. \"I'm for him because the sanctions are hurting us so badly, and I know he can fix them,\" one person said, citing Ghalibaf's economic platform.\n",
      "At one rally, a group of conservative women said they did not like any of the candidates and would not vote. Another group, this one of self-described liberals, offered the same rationale for their plans to stay home.\n",
      "Though a few expressed concerns about speaking publicly to a reporter, others appeared eager to talk.\n",

      "In the 2009 election, massive anti-government demonstrations erupted in violence, followed by reports of dozens of deaths and claims of vote rigging in the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is barred from running for a third term.\n",
      "Efforts appear to have been made to minimize the possibility of a recurrence of violence. College students, who played a major role in the demonstrations four years ago, were sent home when colleges were closed early. Government officials said that that was done to give the students an early break for the summer.\n",
      "\"Foreign media reporters have expressed satisfaction with the government's cooperation and praised the Iranian people's desire to participate in the election,\" Press TV declared flatly on Thursday.\n",
      "Several people complained about the sanctions and the struggling economy. In fact, prices for nearly everything have doubled since last summer. Even the increase in the cost of watermelon, produced aplenty here, has outstripped inflation. By official figures, the inflation rate is 31%; observers say it's more than that. And many here grouse that their costs are rising faster than their salaries. Shrimp was $22 per pound at one store on Thursday.\n",

      "Cui Shufeng is a retired government worker in Beijing. She is one of the lucky homeowners who bought her place long before the housing sector galloped out of reach for the average Chinese salary worker.\n",
      "\"It is ridiculously high,\" she says pointing to apartments in her neighborhood. \"These homes near the school here are CNY 70,000 (USD$11,400) per square meter. It's not even worth 7000 yuan (USD$ 1140) per square meter because it's not even good quality.\"\n",
      "Her concern is on the radar of the central leadership that is expected to discuss economic reforms at the plenary session starting Saturday. For Chinese leaders, the property sector is an emotional and political hot potato. The dream to own a home is a far out of reach for tens of millions of Chinese citizens.\n",
      "In the latest housing data, new home prices for September rose at the fastest pace in almost three years. In Beijing, new home prices were up 16%, Shanghai 17% and Shenzhen 20% from a year ago.\n",
      "\"The problem is Chinese people have very few investment vehicles. They've lost trust in the stock market so they turn to real estate,\" says Xu Si Tao, China Director of the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n",

      "I was in Beijing two weeks ago and visited a luxury villa compound. It was a large site with tens of dozens of completed but mostly empty villas. A worker in the sales office told me the average home was priced at CNY 23 million (USD$3.8 million) and most were sold. He said half were owner-occupied (though I saw very little sign of residents) and the other half purchased as investments.\n",
      "I was told the supermarket in the center of the compound was open and often used by residents. It was clearly still under construction. When I pointed this out, I was then told the grand opening would be next year. Message: The bubble is alive and growing. These villas are a pretty -- and by most appearances, empty -- place to park money.\n",
      "Cui shakes her head at the dilemma facing the government. She doesn't believe recent curbs will work like a ban on third home loans in Shanghai.\n",
      "\"I don't think home prices will drop sharply because our economy is still doing okay,\" she says. \"Our child bought a home in the U.S. recently. The price was about the same as a flat in Beijing, but the area is a lot bigger and the quality is much better.\"\n",

      "O'Brien reached the magical three figures in just 50 balls, smashing the previous best mark of 66 deliveries set by Australia's Matthew Hayden against South Africa in 2007.\n",
      "The 26-year-old O'Brien hit six sixes and 13 fours on his way to 113, helping Ireland reach 329 for seven with five balls to spare, in reply to England's total of 327 for eight from their 50 overs.\n",
      "As well as O'Brien's remarkable innings, Ireland's victory marked the highest second innings run chase in World Cup history -- beating Sri Lanka's 313 against Zimbabwe in New Zealand in 1992\n",
      "Speaking after collecting his man-of-the-match award, O'Brien -- who also played in Ireland's famous 2007 World Cup win over Pakistan -- said: \"I don't think it's quite sunk in.\n",
      "\"It's probably the best innings I've ever played. I just hit the ball pretty well and got a bit of luck and things went my way. I just kept going and kept attacking.\"\n",
      "England came into the match as hot favorites following their thrilling tie against India on Sunday and they looked to be firmly in control when Ireland were reduced to 111 for five.\n",
      "But O'Brien and Alex Cusack went on to score 162 in a superb six-wicket stand before Cusack was eventually run out for 47.\n",
      "However, O'Brien remained at the crease and when he was eventually dismissed with the score on 317, also by run out, Ireland needed just 12 runs from two more overs to secure a famous success.\n",

      "Last week, powerhouse wedding gown designer Vera Wang announced that she and her husband of 23 years, Arthur Becker, were separating.\n",
      "\"Vera Wang and Arthur Becker have mutually and amicably agreed to separate. They remain devoted parents to their two daughters,\" Mario Grauso, the president of the Vera Wang Group, said in a statement to CNN.\n",
      "The couple married in 1989 when Wang was a design director at Ralph Lauren and Becker was a stockbroker at Bear Stearns & Co. Before her tenure at Ralph Lauren, Wang worked at Vogue magazine for more than 15 years.\n",
      "Wang, 63, launched her label in 1990, a year after her own wedding, with a prestigious Madison Avenue address on New York City's Upper East Side. She opened Bridal House Ltd., as it was called at the time, because she noticed something was missing from bridal gowns during her own wedding planning: art.\n",
      "Tamara Albu, an associate professor of fashion design at Parsons The New School of Design, said Wang revolutionized the way people looked at the wedding gown; she upped the sophistication and made the gown an expression of a state of mind, not just a marker of a special occasion.\n",
      "\"She understands women who embrace fashion. In her case, she markets the wedding gown as a personification of love and beauty, not herself,\" she said.\n",
      "However, Wang's recent announcement has caused speculation as to whether her fairy-tale aesthetic will be affected by her own not-so-happily-ever-after ending.\n",
      "Wang's empire has grown into a multitiered, multimillion-dollar effort, a marriage of ready-to-wear and sportswear, as well as bedding, eyewear, fragrance, stationery, luggage, footwear, tableware and flower collections.\n",
      "Ivanka Trump, Chelsea Clinton and Victoria Beckham are just a few of the influential people who have said \"I do\" donning Vera Wang.\n",
      "Nowadays, designers sell a lifestyle, and with it, their clothes and accessories. Diane von Furstenberg is renowned for her iconic wrap dress and signature prints for the ever-sassy career woman -- embodying the DVF label. Donatella Versace is synonymous with over-the-top prints and unabashed sexiness, fitting for her brand's Miami jet-set look.\n",
      "For Wang, it was romanticism.\n",
      "\"Vera Wang is a magnificent designer who has created a unique aspirational world that alludes to sensuality and youthful sophistication. Exquisite details, intricate draping and a nonchalant sense of style characterize the Vera Wang aesthetic,\" Albu said.\n",
      "Does the end of Wang's marriage mean her enchanted empire is in danger? Albu says not necessarily.\n",
      "Wang's Fall 2012 bridal collection departed from the typical matrimonial hues of white and ivory and included several black wedding dresses, while her spring 2013 bridal collection was emblazoned with scarlet-hued gowns.\n",
      "Both are creative decisions Albu says could have been foretelling of Wang's own marital woes.\n",
      "\"I think there is something there. This didn't occur overnight and (is), in a way, a symbolic gesture. Creative people do take their inspiration from everywhere, including their own personal life,\" Albu said.\n",
      "However, fashion experts like Albu also say Wang's customers are looking for their own fantasy -- not trying to mimic the designer's.\n",
      "\"Without doubt, every bride has her own fantasy about her own wedding. Does this fantasy include the personal life of her dress designer? I don't think so,\" Albu said.\n",
      "\"It is about a dream and an image and not a projection of someone that is instrumental in setting the stage,\" she said.\n",
      "Molly R. Leis, who owns the retail marketing firm MRL Communications, agrees Wang's personal life won't drive away sales because she never made it a part of the story.\n",
      "\"The Vera Wang brand does not sell her personal love story nor her marriage, but the soul of a New Yorker dedicated to offering women a luxury lifestyle brand,\" said Leis, who is also a former director of marketing for Saks Fifth Avenue New York.\n",
      "\"Vera sells a lifestyle beyond the wedding. The dream she sells is that of an ambitious, driven, determined woman destined for success. She is often photographed and interviewed alone without mention or sight of her husband,\" she said.\n",
      "Reports have indicated that Becker, a successful businessman, played a significant role in expanding the Vera Wang brand, and neither party has commented on how their marital split might affect the company's operations. But for customers devoted to Wang's designs, it doesn't change the bottom line.\n",
      "Alli Sosna of Washington, D.C., will walk down the aisle on June 8, 2013, in a Wang gown. The 27-year-old says she didn't, and still doesn't, consider the designer's personal life in her decision.\n",
      "\"I saw myself comfortable in my own skin, in a well-fitted elegant dress on a very important day in my life,\" Sosna said.\n",
      "\"The design spoke to me, not the artist's marital status, but what she stands for. If anything, her dresses are probably going to get better since she will be back on the market and falling in love again.\"\n",
      "And if there's anything popular culture loves more than a fairy tale, it's a second chance at love.\n",

      "\"Our bases are not in Pakistan nor do we reside outside of our country in insecure conditions,\" the email sent to Afghan and Pakistani journalists said. \"All military and civilian activities in (Afghanistan) are our own initiatives and our own actions.\"\n",
      "The response came less than a week after Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen said that the Haqqani network, which has carried out a number of high-profile terror attacks in the Afghan capital Kabul and elsewhere, acted \"as a veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence.\"\n",
      "Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the militant group, \"only receives orders from their leader, Mullah Omar,\" according to the Taliban email that also said the U.S. allegations are \"baseless.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, Pakistan continued to deny Mullen's charges.\n",
      "\"Very few countries have been ravaged by the monster of terrorism as brutally as Pakistan,\" Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said in an address this week to the U.N. General Assembly in New York. \"It is Pakistan's firm determination not to allow any space on its territory for militants and terrorists.\"\n",
      "Washington's allegations have strained ties between the two countries, which have been in an uneasy alliance in the war against terror since 2001.\n",
      "The relationship between Pakistani intelligence and the Haqqanis goes back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan when Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States supported the mujahedeen resistance. Intelligence officials believe Pakistan still regards the Haqqanis as an important tool in countering Indian influence in Afghanistan and helping shape any future peace process in line with Islamabad's priorities. With an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 fighters, the Haqqanis' close relationship with both the Afghan and Pakistan Taliban makes them an important player in the region.\n",
      "Major General Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, acknowledged the service has had contacts with the Haqqanis.\n",
      "\"Any intelligence agency would like to maintain contact with whatever opposition group, whatever terrorist organization ... for some positive outcome,\" he told CNN in a telephone interview this month.\n",
      "However, those contacts do not mean that the ISI supports or endorses the organization, he added.\n",
      "Western counterterrorism officials believe that contrary to Pakistan's assertions, the Haqqanis rely on Pakistani territory -- specifically North Waziristan and the Khurram agency -- to organize, resupply and raise funds.\n",
      "The Haqqanis are widely regarded as one of the most effective militant groups in Afghanistan. Western intelligence officials believe the Haqqanis were involved in the assassination this month of the Chairman of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in June. Rabbani himself alleged that the group that attacked the hotel had been in phone contact with people in the town of Miranshah in the Pakistani territory of North Waziristan, long regarded as a stronghold of the Haqqani network.\n",

      "A new photo of Charles Manson shows his gray beard and the swastika tattooed into his forehead.\n",
      "After three decades behind bars, Manson family members Atkins, Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten have repeatedly been described as model prisoners who have accepted responsibility for their crimes.\n",
      "Parole boards, however, continue to reject their bids for release, and a debate rages over whether the four should ever be freed.\n",
      "The release of Manson's prison photo recently rekindled public interest in slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others in a two-night rampage that terrorized the city of Los Angeles, California, in August 1969. CNN looked into the status of some of his former followers.\n",
      "Atkins, California's longest-serving female inmate, requested a \"compassionate release\" from the California Board of Parole Hearings in July. She has terminal brain cancer, doctors say. The board unanimously denied her request.\n",
      "Atkins' 18th parole suitability hearing is scheduled for May 28, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. The Web site says Atkins, now 60, is paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and cannot sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair.\n",
      "Despite her declining condition and spotless prison record, the site says, \"there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society.\"\n",
      "The Manson family members were initially sentenced to death, only to have their sentences commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down death penalty laws in 1972, establishing a four-year moratorium on executions.\n",
      "By her own admission, Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the eight-months-pregnant woman 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate \"asked me to let her baby live ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\"\n",
      "After stabbing Tate to death, according to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins scrawled the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski, who was not home at the time. Three of Tate's house guests were also slain, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage out back.\n",
      "Atkins' compassionate release was opposed by Tate's sister, Debra, Los Angeles County prosecutors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. However, the former prosecutor who won her conviction, Vincent Bugliosi, said he supported Atkins' request for release.\n",
      "Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free. She said the slayings of the victims, including some that may have not been discovered, were \"so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back. \"\n",
      "\"The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,\" Debra Tate said. \"They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do.\"\n",

      "Known as Katie within the Manson Family, Krenwinkel killed coffee heiress Abigail Folger at the Tate home and, the following night, stabbed Rosemary LaBianca and carved the word \"War\" on her husband Leno LaBianca's abdomen.\n",
      "She remained faithful to Manson throughout her trial and into the first few years of her incarceration, according to a profile posted on the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law Web site, but she later \"made strides to turn her life around.\"\n",
      "Now 61, Krenwinkel is a model inmate at the California Institution for Women in Frontera, according to Lt. Robert Patterson, a prison spokesman. She is involved in the Prison Pups program, which helps train puppies to be service dogs, he said.\n",
      "\"It gives you a reason to wake up every morning, and keep moving on,\" Krenwinkel told Los Angeles station KABC, a CNN affiiate. The program at that time had trained more than 100 dogs; Krenwinkel said she was training her seventh dog.\n",
      "According to the Manson Family Today Web site, which keeps tabs on all things related to the case, Krenwinkel has largely accepted the fact that she probably will never leave prison. Her next parole hearing will be sometime before December, Patterson said.\n",
      "Van Houten was convicted in the raid at the LaBianca home, where she helped hold Rosemary LaBianca down as the woman was stabbed to death. At the time, she was 19.\n",
      "\"The autopsy reports have shown that it was Tex that wielded the fatal wounds, but I contributed, and I attempted to hold her down for Pat [Krenwinkel],\" Van Houten said in a 2002 appearance on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" \"I called to Tex because we couldn't kill her. You know, it's -- morally, I feel as though I did.\"\n",
      "Her conviction was overturned in 1976, on the grounds that a judge erred in not granting a mistrial after the disappearance of her attorney, Ronald Hughes, who later was found dead.\n",
      "In Van Houten's first retrial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict, and she was released on bond for a few months. But in her third trial, in 1978, she was convicted of first-degree murder.\n",
      "Known as Lulu within the Manson family, Van Houten, a former high school homecoming queen, is serving her life sentence at the California Institution for Women at Frontera, the same facility as Krenwinkel and, until last year, Atkins.\n",
      "Like Krenwinkel, Van Houten is involved in prison programs and is a mentor to other inmates in the facility's college program, Patterson said. She is also a model inmate, he added.\n",
      "During her 2002 CNN appearance, Van Houten called Manson \"an opportunist of the cruelest, most vicious kind.\" But she was quick to emphasize that she accepts blame for her role in the crime.\n",
      "Like the others, Van Houten, 59, has repeatedly been turned down for parole. She is widely seen as the best candidate for parole. But her next parole hearing probably will not be until 2010, according to Patterson.\n",
      "\"Tex\" Watson's participation in the Manson murders is \"a part of history that he deeply regrets,\" according to a Web site dedicated to his prisoner outreach program.\n",
      "Watson converted to Christianity in 1975, several years after he was incarcerated, and became an ordained minister in 1983, according to the site.\n",
      "\"He was manipulative,\" Watson said of Manson in a November 2004 radio interview, the transcript of which is posted on the Web site. \"But I take full responsibility for my ignorance, lack of identity, emptiness and choices in life, which left me prey to his deceptive plan. My actions were my own.\"\n",
      "Watson stabbed four people, including Tate, to death and fatally shot  two others. After the Tate murders, Watson reportedly told Manson, \"Boy, it sure was helter skelter.\"\n",
      "However, Watson was not tried along with the others in the slayings. A month and a half after the two-night crime spree, he said, he fled to Texas.\n",
      "Watson, now 63, writes on the site that he has no computer or Internet access in prison, but maintains contact with the site administrator through the mail and writes much of the site's content.\n",

      "Nigeria's government is facing rising religious violence in the north, a long-simmering separatist movement in the oil-rich south and now a nationwide strike fueled by widespread anger over the end of fuel subsidies seen by many as one of the few benefits of living in the largely impoverished state.\n",
      "The issues, all intertwined in Nigeria's complicated web of political, ethnic and religious relationships and rivalries, add up to a difficult challenge for the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, who just a few days ago promised a renewed focus on economic, fiscal and education reforms in 2012.\n",
      "\"Jonathan is a president under fire. His actions over the last week are that of a desperate president,\" Nigerian political journalist Terfa Tilley-Gyado said.\n",
      "Particularly curious, Nigeria analyst John Campbell said, is why Jonathan would choose now to resurrect the Nigerian government's repeated efforts to scuttle the fuel subsidy, which is highly popular with the country's 155 million residents -- many of whom live on less than $2 a day.\n",
      "\"One would have thought that in an area of heightened religious conflict that the last thing you would want to do is provoke a general strike,\" said Campbell, a senior fellow for Africa Policy Studies with the Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
      "Read more about what is behind Nigeria's fuel protests\n",
      "Whatever its reasons, finding a way out will be a trick for the government, he said.\n",
      "If the government backs down and restores the subsidy, it may appear weak to northern militants and southern separatists, Campbell said. If it tries to wait out a strike in hopes that the protests will disintegrate, it risks a crippling disruption in the flow of oil, which provides 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange and 80 percent of its government's budget.\n",
      "Read more about Nigerian protests over the end of the fuel subsidy\n",
      "\"The government finds itself, I think, in an extraordinarily difficult situation,\" Campbell said.\n",
      "Until the New Year's Day announcement by Jonathan's government that the country would end fuel subsidies that held down the cost of gasoline for Nigeria's 155 million residents, perhaps the largest immediate crisis facing the administration was the religious violence in the north.\n",
      "More than 30 Christians died in violence last week in Adamawa, prompting a 24-hour curfew in that northwestern Nigerian state to guard against Christian reprisals, a government chaplain said Saturday. Boko Haram, a shadowy militant Islamic group that is said to favor strict Sharia law, is frequently blamed for the sectarian violence.\n",
      "The attacks came several days after the government declared a state of emergency in several areas as Jonathan pledged to continue fighting to quell the violence.\n",
      "\"While we have made progress and overcame most of the challenges on many fields, there have been those amongst us who want to impose their will on the majority of us.\" he said in a New Year's message. \"This government will lead Nigeria and Nigerians to resist such imposition.\"\n",
      "But Jonathan, who took over as president two years ago after the previous president left the country to be treated for a heart problem, has not earned high marks for his handling of the issue, Tilley-Gyado said.\n",
      "Jonathan's recent revelation that Boko Haram sympathizers may have infiltrated the government is particularly vexing, he said.\n",
      "\"Nigerians find it outrageous to hear him say about his government, which he had a major part in putting together, that there are Boko Haram sympathizers within it,\" Tilley-Gyado said. \"People would like to know who they are and what efforts are being made to prosecute them.\"\n",
      "Jonathan has done better at managing the fallout from sporadic attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta region, Tilley-Gyado said. A group called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, has claimed responsibility for some of those acts out of frustration with how the country's oil wealth is distributed.\n",
      "Searing anger as Nigerians protests fuel price rise\n",
      "Nigeria is the world's 10th largest oil producer, according to the CIA.\n",
      "But little of the money oil brings in comes back to residents of the Delta region, Campbell noted.\n",
      "And government plans to embark on a building program in the Muslim-dominated north, along with threats of reprisals against Muslims over the killing of Christians, threaten to inflame tensions in the south and reopen wounds from the country's civil war in the late 1960s, Campbell said.\n",
      "That conflict left as many as 3 million people dead.\n",
      "Such concerns prompted prominent Nigerian authors, including the 1986 Nobel Prize winning playwright Wole Soyinka, to issue a statement urging calm.\n",
      "\"The fears we have all secretly nursed are coming to realisation.\" said Soyinka, novelist Chinua Achebe and poet and playwright J.P. Clark. \"Rumblings and veiled threats have given way to eruption, and the first cracks in the wall of patience and forbearance can no longer be wished away. Boko Haram is very likely celebrating its first tactical victory: provoking retaliation in some parts of the nation.\"\n",
      "Against the backdrop of these issues, along with Nigeria's staggering poverty and critical infrastructure issues, Jonathan announced last week that the government was ending a fuel subsidy, saving nearly $7 billion a year, according to the government.\n",
      "The money is being redirected to a wide-ranging infrastructure construction program, additional social spending and economic initiatives, the government said.\n",
      "But those plans didn't salve the pain for many Nigerians, who responded explosively to the proposal, which is the latest in a series of failed efforts dating back decades by the Nigerian government to eliminate the popular subsidy.\n",
      "\"We still don't have light,\" travel and tourism business owner Shade Ladipo told CNN last week. \"The roads are terrible. It was already hard to live in Nigeria. This will make life even worse.\"\n",
      "Protests quickly morphed into a call for a general strike by trade unions, which have not enjoyed particularly strong support in Nigeria despite low wages and poor working conditions, Campbell said.\n",
      "Those strikes succeeded in shutting down wide swaths of the country, according to union and media accounts. In some places, police clashed with protesters.\n",
      "Much of the anger has to do with a sense that Nigerian elites are not sharing in the sacrifice Jonathan says is necessary to move Nigeria forward, Tilley-Gyado said.\n",
      "In fact, protesters have adopted the \"Occupy\" moniker that has characterized protests against what protesters consider to be greed on the part of corporations and the very rich.\n",
      "\"With the fuel subsidy, he has put the cart before the horse and has not assured Nigerians that the austerity measures that have been imposed on them are being shared by the those who rule the country,\" he said. \"The sheer cost of running the government is draining Nigeria's fortunes.\"\n",
      "In a January 7 speech, Jonathan said elimination of the subsidy was a tough but necessary choice for the country's economic future.\n",
      "\"I am determined to leave behind a better Nigeria, that we all can be proud of. To do so, I must make sure that we have the resources and the means to grow our economy to be resilient, and to sustain improved livelihood for our people. We must act in the public interest, no matter how tough, for the pains of today cannot be compared to the benefits of tomorrow,\" he said, according to a transcript posted to his Facebook page.\n",
      "Campbell said he was still mystified at the decision to suddenly resurrect an issue that has dogged the Nigerian government for decades.\n",
      "\"But whenever you're dealing with Nigeria, there's a lot you don't know,\" he said.\n",
      "Labor leaders vow to keep up the pressure on the government indefinitely, saying in a statement on the National Labour Congress website that \"the will of the Nigerian people must prevail over that of any government in power.\n",

      "President Barack Obama will find that much has changed in Mexico when he arrives on May 2. Our neighbor to the South -- and second-largest export market -- has moved far ahead with reforms.\n",
      "As Congress crafts comprehensive immigration legislation, Democrats and Republicans must keep in mind that Mexico is changing rapidly, and policies crafted to reflect yesterday's Mexico will not help the U.S. make the most of the potential of today's and tomorrow's Mexico.\n",
      "Mexico's future is bright, and tapping into this growth and economic prosperity is vital to U.S. competitiveness. But the U.S. needs immigration reform to build on its huge bilateral trade with Mexico -- more than $1 billion in goods and services each day, or $45 million an hour.\n",
      "Mexico's President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has achieved in less than five months in office what eluded previous administrations for six years. In the second half of 2013, he hopes to add energy to the improvements in education and telecommunications that are sailing through under the umbrella of the Pact for Mexico political agreement.\n",
      "Demographic and economic transformations in Mexico mean that the U.S. can expect the number of Mexicans coming into the U.S. to slow to a trickle. Mexicans make up about 58% of the 11 million in the U.S. without authorization.\n",
      "The Pew Hispanic Center reports zero net migration from 2005 to 2010, with about 1.4 million Mexicans both entering and leaving the United States. Pew demographers even raise the possibility that the return flow may be exceeding the number of Mexicans coming north.\n",
      "The reasons for the drop in Mexican migration are a combination of changes in the \"push\" and \"pull\" factors that determine migratory patterns. The decline in the \"pull\" factor is all too well-known -- it's no longer so desirable to migrate to the U.S. for jobs.\n",
      "But Mexico's rise also means that going north is a less attractive option for getting ahead in life. Its economy grew at more than double the rate of the U.S. last year, with a projected 3.5% growth in 2013. Between 2005 and 2008, as noted in Americas Society and Council of the Americas \"Get the Facts\" series, the number of new Mexican businesses created each year increased by 27%, which is 2.5 times the G20 average.\n",
      "Over the same period, the number of students in Mexico graduating from advanced university level programs increased by 11%.\n",
      "If the February education reform, aimed at improving standards to boost the overall quality of education, is successful, more young Mexicans will have the training to compete in the 21st century workforce. In the past decade, the Mexican middle class grew by 17%, and in just two generations, the fertility rate dropped nearly 70% -- signaling the end of the youth bulge that contributed to the \"push\" to the United States.\n",
      "Mexico is a hub of business activity. Despite the insecurity in certain parts of the country, Mexican entrepreneurs and foreign companies are setting up shop.\n",
      "Guadalajara is fast-becoming Mexico's Silicon Valley with tech entrepreneurs from across Mexico flocking to the capital of Jalisco state. At the same time, as wages rise in China, firms are relocating their manufacturing options to Mexico, where wages remain competitive and where products have easier access to the U.S. and Canadian markets through the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n",
      "Comprehensive immigration reform will open a gateway to one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies. By providing a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants of Mexican origin, reform will make it easier for laborers to cross borders, which will harness the competitiveness of both countries. It would also show that the U.S. is a true economic partner with Mexico and the rest of the Americas.\n",
      "Legal status would open the door for these immigrants and their children to further increase their contributions to the U.S. economy and to start small businesses that would capitalize on their cross-border networks. This is a highly likely scenario as immigrants are more likely to start a business than those born in the U.S., and Mexicans represent the greatest number of foreign-born small-business owners.\n",
      "At the same time, greater emphasis on a demand-driven visa system would create new ways for workers to enter the U.S. who will be increasingly needed as baby boomers retire.\n",
      "Also critical for increasing cross-border trade is improving efficiency at the border. Any new border security plan should improve infrastructure and technology to reduce the congestion that delays trade. Improved trade means more U.S. jobs, with 6 million, or 1 in 24 jobs, across 22 states attributed to bilateral commerce.\n",
      "Undocumented immigration will keep declining as more Mexicans find new opportunities at home. That means the big question for Congress to consider should be how to ensure that our immigration system helps North American competitiveness and prosperity, and how the U.S. can attract the workers -- including Mexicans-- it will need.\n",

      "On a tally of 58 to 42, a procedural vote failed to get the supermajority 60 votes it needed to advance.\n",
      "Supporters of the USA Freedom Act, a rare mix of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans, hoped public outrage over the secret mass collection of phone and Internet records -- revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- would lead to passage of the reforms.  But many opponents argued the changes would hamper the National Security Agency's ability to track nimble and elusive terrorists.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The global financial crisis has increased the worldwide trade in trafficked persons, says a State Department report released Tuesday.\n",
      "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the report aims \"to shine the light brightly on ... modern slavery.\"\n",
      "The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report also says trafficking has increased in Africa and slaps six African nations on a blacklist of countries not meeting the minimum standard of combating trafficking.\n",
      "The report, mandated by Congress, features data and statistics from 175 countries around the world regarding the amount of human trafficking that goes on within their borders.\n",
      "The report cites the International Labor Organization, which estimates that at least 12.3 million adults and children are victims of forced labor, bonded labor and sex slavery each year.\n",
      "\"This is modern slavery. A crime that spans the globe, providing ruthless employers with endless supply of people to abuse for financial gain,\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said as she announced the report. \"With this report, we hope to shine the light brightly on the scope and scale of modern slavery, so all governments can see where progress has been made and where more is needed.\"\n",
      "The report says the global economic crisis is boosting the demand for human trafficking because of a growing demand for cheap goods and services.\n",
      "\"A striking global demand for labor and a growing supply of workers willing to take ever greater risks for economic opportunities seem a recipe for increased forced labor cases of migrant workers and women in prostitution,\" it says.\n",
      "It predicts that the economic crisis will push more businesses underground to avoid taxes and unionized labor, which will increase the use of forced, cheap and child labor by cash-strapped multinational companies.\n",
      "African countries Nigeria and Mauritius are praised in the report for making strong efforts to combat trafficking.\n",
      "But six African nations -- Chad, Eritrea, Mauritania, Niger, Swaziland and Zimbabwe -- were put on the report's \"Tier 3\" blacklist of countries whose efforts to combat trafficking are inadequate.\n",
      "Most of the countries are \"source\" and \"destination\" countries, the report says, meaning trafficking victims both come from and are sent there. Most are trafficked throughout Africa, but many end up in the Middle East, it says.\n",
      "Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria remain on the blacklist for another year, with the report saying they often become a destination for trafficked persons who are sold into domestic servitude. Other repeat offenders on the list include North Korea, Myanmar and Fiji.\n",
      "The State Department also put Malaysia in the Tier 3 list, because of its trafficking of Burmese refugees.\n",
      "The report cites information that Malaysian immigration officials sold refugees to traffickers operating along its border with Thailand. When the victims were unable to pay a ransom demanded by the traffickers, the report says, they were sold for labor and commercial sex exploitation.\n",
      "The blacklisted countries are subject to U.S. sanctions if they don't make greater efforts to fight trafficking.\n",
      "The Philippines, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Pakistan were added to a \"watch list\" because of what the report calls a worsening trafficking record in those countries. The 52 countries on the watch list have failed to to meet the minimum anti-trafficking standards but are making efforts to do so.\n",
      "For the first time, countries that have been on the watch list for two years -- including China, Russia, India, Sri Lanka and Egypt -- will automatically be moved to the Tier 3 blacklist next year without a presidential waiver if they fail improve their trafficking record, the State Department said.\n",
      "This year, the Justice Department also put out a report on U.S. efforts to combat trafficking efforts at home. In 2008, the FBI opened 132 trafficking investigations, made 139 arrests and obtained 94 convictions.\n",
      "Clinton invited to Tuesday's event members of Congress who are active on the issue, as well as global advocates for trafficking victims, in an effort to give the issue a higher profile and shine a spotlight on the need to combat it.\n",
      "Calling for a renewed worldwide partnership between countries and non-governmental organizations to combat trafficking, Clinton said, \"Trafficking thrives in the shadows, and it can be easy to dismiss it as something that happens to someone else, somewhere else. But that's not the case.\n",
      "\"Trafficking is a crime that involves every nation on Earth, and that includes our own,\" she said, calling trafficking a \"grave problem\" in the United States.\n",
      "For the first time, she said, the United States next year will rank its own efforts at combating trafficking along with the rest of the world. She expressed hope that it will be on the Tier 1 list of countries that are making robust efforts.\n",

      "The ministry announced Wednesday that it was temporarily halting its controversial whale hunting season, blaming the Sea Shepherd activists for impeding the hunt.\n",
      "Japan annually hunts whales, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the auspices it is conducting scientific research. The moratorium allows the culling of whales for purposes of scientific research.\n",
      "Critics call Japan's hunt a cover for commercial whaling, since the whale meat ends up in supermarkets and restaurants. Animal rights groups, from Greenpeace to Sea Shepherd, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand, have publicly condemned Japan's hunts.\n",
      "Despite the condemnations, Japan continued to hunt whales.\n",
      "Sea Shepherd activists in 2005 started a renegade battle in the high seas against Japan's whalers. They've had a number of high profile clashes, most notably last year, when one of Japan's whaling vessels collided with the Sea Shepherd's Ady Gil speedboat.\n",
      "The captain of the Ady Gil, Paul Bethune, then snuck aboard the Japanese whaling vessel. Bethune, a New Zealand citizen, was arrested and tried in Japan. Bethune was convicted of assault, vandalism and three other charges but released on a suspended prison term.\n",

They're so far in debt right now, they're financially so strapped, even the Japanese government is saying, how much will we pump into this? It's a dying industry. It has no place in the 21st century.

      "The vote was 68 in favor and 55 against, with nine abstentions.\n",
      "Those who see the ancient tradition as animal cruelty were ecstatic about the vote, celebrating in the street outside parliament. Fans of bullfighting said the decision, however, does not mean it will disappear from other regions in Spain.\n",
      "Some analysts have said Catalan nationalism -- including the desire by some in the region for independence from Spain -- played a part in the vote. The upcoming regional elections for parliament later this year may have also had a role.\n",

      "Guillen's father worked at the bullring, opening the doors for bulls to charge in to face matadors and their death.\n",
      "\"My father brought me to see the bullfights when I still had a pacifier,\" Guillen said. \"It would be frustrating not to be able to give to my children what my parents gave to me.\"\n",
      "The number of bullfights across Spain has dropped by a third in recent years, mostly because of the budget constraints of local governments, which often fund the spectacles.\n",
      "In Catalonia, there are now just more than a dozen fights a year and the Monumental bullring in Barcelona is one of the few places in the region that still holds fights.\n",
      "A pro-bullfighting group called PPDF released a study predicting big economic losses for Catalonia if bullfighting were banned, mainly because the Catalan government would have to pay damages to the bullfighting industry, which holds long-term operating licenses.\n",
      "\"When the Catalan government and the opposition are working hard to trim the budget, how could they justify making big indemnity payments to the bullfighting industry, when it's not necessary,\" PPDF President Luis Corrales said.\n",

      "The proposal to ban bullfighting started as a popular initiative in Catalonia and was accepted for consideration by parliament last year by a slim margin of votes. Since then, there has been an ever-intensifying debate, with bullfighting proponents and opponents gathering support from across Spain, even from abroad.\n",

      "The new parliament will be elected as the country prepares to usher in constitutional changes that will go into effect once Saakashvili's term ends in 2013.\n",
      "The new system, according to Thomas de Waal, an expert on Georgia and senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, will shift power from the president to a prime minister.\n",
      "\"The prime minister will be chosen by parliament, which thus hands important powers to whichever political force obtains a majority in parliament in the October 1 elections,\" de Waal said.\n",
      "\"Parliament will be the main body running Georgia, so it will be a much more diluted power,\" Saakashvili said. \"There will no longer be a strong man or stakeholder of power and I think that is a fair system because in democracy there are checks and balances for different people.\"\n",
      "Until recently, Saakashvili and the United National Movement have controlled much of political life in this country of 4.5 million people and has been praised by U.S. and European officials for making progress in the fight against corruption and continuing economic reform.\n",
      "The evidence can be seen in gleaming new skyscrapers.\n",

      "The president said he is concerned with the amount of wealth that Ivanishvili made in Russia, and that that money is being used to influence the elections.\n",
      "\"We know what Russian money is all about,\" he said. \"How it was made, what kind of methods were used, and certainly it is a source of concern,\" he said.\n",

      "The billionaire said he has sold all his Russian assets, and defended his reputation.\n",
      "But the president insisted that not only the opposition leader but Putin himself is trying to undermine Georgia.\n",

      "Saakashvili said his government acted quickly and decisively to the video, citing an investigation that has led to arrests.\n",

They both are claiming total victory, and this, obviously, will have some impact in the U.S., because both sides will be looking to the U.S. and calling on the U.S. to be arbiter, which is rather an unrealistic thing to happen, but I think Washington's going to have to brace itself for those calls.\"\n",

      "Magoline Hazelton is used to people driving by her home just to take a look. She's also known as the \"house lady\" by her fellow residents in North Charleston, South Carolina.\n",
      "Steel shipping containers, like these at a depot, can be turned into homes.\n",
      "From the outside, Hazelton's home doesn't seem much different from the rest of the neighborhood. But there's one big difference. Her house is made from cargo shipping containers.\n",
      "Using containers to build homes has increasingly become a trend in the past several years because it can be cheaper and faster than using traditional construction methods. There are also plenty of containers at most major ports.\n",
      "About 18 million containers are used worldwide to transport a variety of everyday products, such as cars, toys and food. Because the United States imports more than it exports, many containers end up stacked at ports.  See one of the homes being built »\n",
      "SG Blocks, a company whose name stands for safe and green blocks, has made a business from the container overflow.\n",
      "Co-founder David Cross previously worked as a merchant marine and spent a lot of time at sea, dealing with shipping containers.\n",
      "\"As you're looking down the deck of the vessel, you see hundreds to thousands of containers perfectly configured,\" Cross said. \"They were stacked nine high below deck, five or six high on deck, and I just kept seeing hotel after hotel on the deck of our ship.\"  Watch how residents like living in the homes »\n",
      "Cross also saw value in the strength of the material.\n",
      "\"The containers are designed for hostile dynamic life at sea ... capable of carrying 60,000 pounds. It just made imminent sense, that with minor modification, it could become a multi-family living system.\"\n",
      "In 2003, Cross partnered with engineer Steve Armstrong to help bring the idea to fruition. A year later, Hazelton's house was built in South Carolina.\n",
      "According to Cross, modifying containers into homes uses significantly less energy than melting them down.\n",
      "\"These containers weigh about 9,000 pounds, and it takes about 9,000 kilowatt hours of energy to melt down 9,000 pounds of steel,\" Cross said. \"We modify that existing piece of steel with approximately 400 kilowatt hours of energy input. [That's a] 95 percent energy footprint reduction.\"\n",
      "The energy saved by transforming a single container into a home, rather than melting it down, can power a standard 70-watt lightbulb for up to 15 years.\n",
      "The time it takes to assemble a container home can vary, according to Cross. Hazelton's home took 10 weeks to build. Generally, SG Blocks has found that recycled homes cut construction time in half.\n",
      "\"Typical homes can take four to eight months [to build],\" Cross said. \"For container homes, it's usually two to four months.\"\n",
      "According to Armstrong, who is president of SG Blocks, the cost of building a single family container home is comparable to a traditional home.\n",
      "\"But you get a steel home instead of a wood home,\" he said. \"So, it's more durable and has a lower carbon footprint. It's also water resistant and termite resistant.\"\n",
      "The construction becomes cheaper as you get into multi-family homes. According to Armstrong, multi-family mid-rise units cost 10 to 15 percent less than typical \"stick frame\" homes.\n",
      "\"That's a lot to do with speed and ease of construction,\" he said.\n",
      "Companies around the world are using shipping containers as building materials to create offices, army barracks, dorms and even designer homes.\n",
      "\"[We] can make these look like anything you want. [We] can put a pretty dress on any skeleton,\" Armstrong said. \"So, if you want it minimalistic, so you can see the container walls, we can do that. If you want stucco or brick or siding, [we] can do that as well.\"\n",
      "While each container has its own roof, when multiple containers are put together side by side, there are gaps between the boxes. Therefore, a traditional roof is put on top of the entire home, providing additional safety in inclement weather.\n",
      "\"When the boxes are joined together, the gaps are sealed, so even if you lose your roof above, you'd have some protection,\" said Armstrong.\n",
      "The second roof also provides another benefit. Hazelton finds she can't even hear the rain hitting her home when it's pouring outside.\n",
      "Her house has been almost maintenance free since she moved in.\n",
      "\"The only thing I've done here is exchanged the hot water heater. Nothing else I've had to do in the last five years ... so far, it's pretty good.\"\n",

      "It has always held out the promise -- despite the odds -- of advancement for young men with the talent and guts to succeed in an often bloody undertaking, beginning with the arrival of the Irish in the mid-19th century, and for African- Americans and the later influx of Jews, Italians and Hispanics, whether U.S.-born, from Mexico or from the Caribbean.\n",
      "Three of the earliest success stories in this history were men of Mexican-American heritage from Los Angeles: Solomon Garcia Smith in the 1880s; Joe Salas, the first Latino to medal in boxing in the Olympics, in 1924; and Bert Colima, Pacific Coast champion in three divisions during the 1920s.\n",
      "These men challenged the notion that Spanish-surnamed men were not good athletes with the physical capability and mental acumen to succeed in corporeal competition.\n",
      "In subsequent decades, Latinos continually proved themselves worthy in the boxing ring and on the baseball diamond, the football field, the basketball court, and elsewhere.\n",
      "Little by little, as economic and educational circumstances improved during the years following World War II, such athletes came to represent local communities, and a few competed at the professional level.\n",
      "While the world of sport did come to recognize talent of Latino participants, many female athletes continued to be shortchanged for most of the 20th century.\n",
      "In recent decades, the playing field has been leveled substantially, in part due to Title IX -- the 1972 law that increased opportunities for women in high school and college athletics -- and a series of court decisions.\n",
      "Still, there remain barriers -- economic, educational, familial, and cultural -- to increasing the percentage of Latinas participating in athletics.\n",
      "My recent work documents the struggles that young women confront as they seek opportunities to play soccer and other sports in Midwestern communities that have seen an explosion in their Hispanic populations in recent decades.\n",
      "Many of these young women are keen to share in the triumphs and joys of athletic competition on behalf of their hometowns. Some even aspire to earn athletic scholarships that assist their families in paying for college, but their hopes are often checked.\n",
      "Marlen Esparza, a Latina boxer vying for the Olympics, follows the tradition of other Latino athletes who broke barriers.\n",
      "They compete for their own success and glory, but also enter the boxing ring or take to the field for other Latinos who will never vie for professional titles.\n",
      "Their stories exemplify two key issues affecting our nation's future: first, the demographic transformation of small town America, and second, the role of sport as a vehicle to break down barriers between \"new arrivals\" and their neighbors.\n",
      "As Marlen Esparza and other Latinas gain acceptance in \"nontraditional\" sports, the path for young girls in small towns gets a bit easier. The success of Esparza at a national level demonstrates the possibilities that participation in sport can have for this generation.\n",
      "A chance to compete on the basketball court and soccer field can open entirely new social and academic prospects for young women. And by wearing the name of their school on their jerseys, Latina athletes are seen as local heroes who are accepted by the general populace.\n",
      "Just as Italian-Americans reveled in the triumphs of Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra, likewise it is conceivable that a greater sense of pride, acceptance, and community may result from Latinas bringing fame to their hometowns through their on-field exploits.\n",

      "Were the commission to pull Penn State's accreditation -- which it has not done -- the school would face the loss of eligibility for federal student aid programs, guaranteed student loans, federal research grants and could lose eligibility for state aid, commission spokesman Richard Pockrass said in July.\n",

      "The commission voted August 6 to place the school on warning status. Two days later, it notified Penn State officials that the school's accreditation was \"in jeopardy\" based on information contained in former FBI Director Louis Freeh's report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky and a National Collegiate Athletic Association action against the school.\n",
      "Freeh found that Penn State's leadership showed \"total and consistent disregard\" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky, the former assistant football coach convicted by a jury in June on 45 counts involving child sex abuse. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September.\n",

      "Last month, the NCAA fined Penn State $60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011.\n",
      "The commission also said it had insufficient evidence that Penn State officials had followed commission rules about how schools are to be governed and whether it had provided \"accurate, fair and complete information\" about what was happening at the school, according to the letter.\n",
      "The commission asked Penn State to report by September 30 on the steps it is taking to ensure full compliance with accreditation requirements, as well as information about the school's financial capacity to meet ongoing obligations considering the potential fallout from civil lawsuits expected over the scandal.\n",
      "A team assembled by the commission will visit Penn State after the September report to evaluate the school's performance, the commission said.\n",
      "Bowen said the commission \"wants us to document that steps we have already taken and are planning to take will ensure our full compliance with its requirements\" and emphasized that the school expects no loss of accreditation.\n",
      "\"It is critical to emphasize that Middle States does not issue a warning unless the commission believes that an institution has the capacity to make appropriate improvements within a reasonable period and then sustain itself to stay in compliance,\" Bowen said in the statement. \"This certainly is true for Penn State. We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission.\"\n",
      "CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the warning seemed to be a bit of \"piling on\" in light of the sanctions already in place against Penn State. But it may be another factor to further motivate the university to comprehensively deal with the scandal, he said on CNN's \"Starting Point.\"\n",

      "The dispute began in 2007 when the Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs, which grants publishing licenses, threatened to withdraw the Herald's permit for using the Arabic word in its Malay-language edition, on the grounds of national security and public order.\n",
      "Malaysian authorities say non-Muslim literature that contains the word could confuse Muslims and cause them to convert away from Islam, which is a crime in many parts of the country.\n",
      "Christian leaders argue that the word \"Allah\" predates Islam, and has long been used in Malay-language bibles and other texts to refer to God.\n",
      "Anti-Christian violence\n",
      "The dispute has sparked violence in recent years against Malaysia's Christian community, which accounts for around 9% of the country's population of 29 million, while more than 60% are Muslim.\n",
      "A series of fire bomb attacks were carried out on places of worship after a court ruled in 2009 that the Church had a constitutional right to refer to God as \"Allah\" in the Herald.\n",
      "But an appeals court reinstated the ban in October 2013. Three months later, arsonists set fire to a church in Kuala Lumpur, and Islamic authorities confiscated hundreds of bibles containing the word \"Allah\" from a Christian organization in the state of Selangor.\n",
      "On Monday, a panel of judges at the Federal Court in Putrajaya ruled 4 to 3 that the word was not an integral part of the Christian faith, upholding the decision of the appeals court.\n",
      "Outside the building, hundreds of Muslim activists celebrated the verdict, shouting \"Allahuakbar\" (God is great).\n",
      "\"We thank Allah because the court's decision has favored us this time. We hope that this is no longer an issue in the peninsular, which does not allow others (to use) the term,\" the head of Perkasa, a conservative Muslim rights group, told reporters.\n",
      "Father Andrew from the Herald said the Church was looking into ways to challenge the ban.\n",
      "\"We need to fight this case to end, because we have to fight for justice when justice is derided or denied,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We have a moral obligation to champion the cause of minorities. We have a responsibility to uphold religious freedom.\"\n",
      "Politics\n",
      "It's likely that the ban is politically motivated, according to William Case, a political scientist with the City University of Hong Kong's Department of Asian and International Studies.\n",
      "Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak is a reformist to some extent, says Case, but his party failed to win a majority in the last election and he needs to recapture the support of the country's ethnic Malay, and mostly Muslim, community.\n",
      "However, it's too soon to tell how the Malaysian government will implement the ban in practice, he says.\n",
      "\"This is the kind of ambiguity you would expect, because it's a very complex and tense set of circumstances. You might have the judiciary saying one thing, the cabinet saying another -- meanwhile pressure is mounting from the many Muslim groups involved who bring tremendous mass-based support, and on the other side from Christian groups.\"\n",
      "The ruling may lead to further attacks on churches, Case warned.\n",
      "\"We do know that Malaysia has become more and more polarized in recent years on ethnic, and increasingly religious, grounds -- and that's becoming more and more severe.\"\n",
      "But while the latest court ruling is distressing, Case says verbal threats against religious groups in Malaysia seldom translate into the kind of violence seen in neighboring countries, like Indonesia.\n",
      "\"We don't see extrajudicial killings, religious-inspired violence and abductions, and that distinguishes Malaysia in the region.\"\n",

      "Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated Thursday in Rawalpindi, was the first female prime minister of Pakistan and of any Islamic nation. She led Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996.\n",
      "Benazir Bhutto died Thursday after a suicide bombing at a political rally in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.\n",
      "Bhutto, 54, spent eight years in self-imposed exile in Great Britain and Dubai after President Farooq Leghari dismissed her second administration amid accusations of corruption, intimidation of the judiciary, a breakdown of law and order, and undermining the justice system.\n",
      "She was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to five years in prison. The conviction was later overturned but she remained in exile until this year.\n",
      "She returned to Pakistan in October after President Pervez Musharraf signed an amnesty lifting corruption charges.  Watch political history of Bhutto »\n",
      "In a September 26 interview on CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Bhutto said she expected threats against her life as she prepared to lead a push for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan.\n",
      "\"After military dictatorship an anarchic situation developed, which the terrorists and Osama (bin Laden) have exploited,\" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"They don't want democracy, they don't want me back, and they don't believe in women governing nations, so they will try to plot against me.\n",
      "\"But these are risks that must be taken. I'm prepared to take them,\" she said.\n",
      "Bhutto narrowly escaped injury on October 18 when a suicide bombing near her convoy in Karachi killed 126 people.\n",
      "\"Soon thereafter, I was asked by authorities not to travel in cars with tinted windows -- which protected me from identification by terrorists -- or travel with privately armed guards,\" she wrote for CNN.com in November.\n",
      "\"I began to feel the net was being tightened around me when police security outside my home in Karachi was reduced, even as I was told that other assassination plots were in the offing.\"\n",
      "\"I decided not to be holed up in my home, a virtual prisoner,\" she wrote. \"I went to my ancestral village of Larkana to pray at my father's grave. Everywhere, the people rallied around me in a frenzy of joy. I feel humbled by their love and trust.\"\n",
      "Musharraf declared a state of emergency and placed Bhutto under house arrest twice in November as anti-government rallies grew in Rawalpindi. The arrest warrant was lifted November 16.\n",
      "She filed a nomination paper for a parliamentary seat on November 25 and appeared headed for a power showdown with Musharraf before she was assassinated Thursday.  See a timeline of Bhutto's political career »\n",
      "Bhutto was the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former president and prime minister of Pakistan, who was hanged in 1979 for the murder of a political opponent two years after he was ousted as prime minister in a military coup. Benazir Bhutto was the de facto leader of her father's Pakistan People's Party.\n",
      "Her brother, Murtaza, was killed along with six others in a 1996 shootout with police at his home. Another brother, Shahnawaz, died mysteriously in France in 1985.\n",
      "\"I know the past is tragic, but I'm an optimist by nature,\" Bhutto told Blitzer in September. \"I put my faith in the people of Pakistan, I put my faith in God. I feel that what I am doing is for a good cause, for a right cause -- to save Pakistan from extremists and militants and to build regional security.\n",
      "\"I know the danger is out there, but I'm prepared to take those risks.\"\n",
      "Benazir Bhutto earned degrees from Radcliffe College and Oxford University and received an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1989.\n",
      "She leaves her husband of 20 years, Asif Ali Zardari, two daughters and a son.\n",
      "Bhutto's husband issued a statement Thursday from his home in Dubai saying, \"All I can say is we're devastated, it's a total shock.\"\n",
      "President Bush, on his ranch in Crawford, Texas, said Bhutto \"refused to allow assassins to dictate the course of her country.\"\n",
      "\"We stand with the people of Pakistan in their struggle against the forces of terror and extremism,\" Bush said. \"We urge them to honor Benazir Bhutto's memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life.\" E-mail to a friend\n",

      "\"Oi -- Sejam bem-vindos!\" -- meaning \"Hi, welcome!\" -- is a Portuguese phrase heard more and more these days at Florida's tourist spots.\n",
      "That's because Florida is the top U.S. vacation destination for Brazilians, who are taking advantage of a favorable exchange rate and low prices. Brazilians outnumbered all other international travelers to Florida in 2011, up 41% from the previous year, according to state tourism officials.\n",
      "And there's no sign of this Brazilian invasion slowing down: The U.S. Commerce Department projects 1.5 million Brazilians will visit the United States in 2012 -- and most of them will head to Florida.\n",
      "Floridians are used to seeing Brazilian tour groups marching through outlet malls and theme parks, usually dressed in matching T-shirts in single-file lines behind their leader. These Brazilian tourists are usually loaded with cash and ready to clear the shelves of the name-brand outlets. That's because even at regular price, many goods and services in the United States are much cheaper than in Brazil, where tariffs, taxes and transportation costs can mean higher prices.\n",
      "\"We [took] about 15,000 passengers on shopping tours, and they on average spend about $300 to $400 each person,\" said Claudia Menezes, vice president of Pegasus Transportation. And those were just the Brazilian tour groups visiting outlet malls and theme parks in South Florida and Orlando.\n",
      "Menezes says she expects her business to double in 2012. That could be a conservative estimate as the United States plans to expand its global entry program, which aims to speed up the visa approval process for international visitors.\n",
      "President Obama announced the expansion of the plan last week at a news conference at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. He said he hopes to make it easier for visitors from countries \"with rapidly growing economies, huge populations and emerging middle classes\" like Brazil and China to visit the United States. He said he wants the plan expanded \"this year.\"\n",
      "He said Brazil was \"especially important for Florida\" because it has \"a huge population that loves to come to Florida ... but we make it too hard for them.\"\n",
      "\"We want them spending money here, in Orlando, in Florida in the United States of America, which will boost our businesses and our economy,\" he said.\n",
      "It's a long process for many Brazilians to get to the United States: On average, people have to wait 76 days just to get an interview at the largest U.S. consulate in Brazil, in Sao Paulo. And with only four U.S. consular offices in a country that is bigger than the continental United States, a lot of Brazilians trying to visit the U.S. must travel long distances for their interview. As a result, many are opting to travel to Europe because the visa process is easier.\n",
      "Menezes says her tour business depends on the United States improving its visa process:\n",
      "\"If they make it easier, it would be even more people coming here,\" she said.\n",
      "On a recent afternoon at the Orlando Premium Outlets near Disney World, one of the hottest-selling items among the Brazilian tourists is luggage. They buy the suitcases, then stuff them with recently purchased shoes, clothing, bags and electronics until the luggage is almost bursting at the seams.\n",
      "That kind of spending has translated into billions of dollars in revenue for the United States. In 2010, Brazilian visitors spent nearly $6 billion on U.S. travel and tourism-related goods and services, nearly 30% more than the prior year, according to a report from the U.S. Commerce Department. It's a trend that has been going on since 2003 and has, according to the report, \"propelled Brazil up the rankings to become the fifth largest international market for U.S. travel and tourism-related exports.\"\n",
      "Florida's retailers aren't the only ones getting an economic boost: Many of Central Florida's numerous theme parks have also seen a large increase in Brazilian tourists. Disney World says 2011 was a record-breaking year for Brazilian guests at its parks.\n",
      "As a result, Disney hired 54 Portuguese-speaking \"Super Greeters,\" most of them from Brazil, to assist Brazilian tour groups throughout Disney's parks.\n",
      "SeaWorld Orlando has seen a steady increase in guests from Brazil over the past five years, says Peter Frey, senior marketing officer with SeaWorld Parks.\n",
      "As a result, SeaWorld recently launched a website in Portuguese, and Frey says the company is looking to expand its Portuguese-speaking employees.\n",
      "\"We are offering classes for employees to learn the basics of Portuguese,\" he said.\n",
      "Brazil's economy is booming after a quick recovery from the global economic downturn, and a new class of Brazilians is traveling and spending money, giving Florida a much-needed economic shot in the arm, according to Sean Snaith, an economics expert at the University of Central Florida.\n",
      "\"There is an emerging middle class [in Brazil] who has disposable income,\" he said.\n",
      "Only a few years ago, Brazilian tourists were not always welcomed by shop owners in Central and South Florida, a tour guide said. Today, businesses are catering to these cash-laden Brazilian tourists.\n",
      "Brazilians are also investing in Florida's sagging real estate market, particularly in South Florida, either for a vacation home or just as an investment. The prices in Miami are a bargain, compared with the prices in Brazil, according to Miami Realtor Cristiano Piquet.\n",
      "\"In Brazil or Rio, high-end real estate is around $1,000 per square foot, while in Miami, you can find high-end oceanfront property, like the Trump Towers, for only $500 per square foot,\" said Piquet, who gets 80% of his business from Brazilians. He has 75 agents.\n",
      "\"Brazilians love Miami, the weather is similar to Brazil, [it's] very safe ... [and there are] daily flights from Brazil to Miami,\" he said.\n",
      "Diego Gasques from Rio de Janeiro, who owns two condominiums in Miami, agrees.\n",
      "\"It's kind of a vacation place for us,\" he said. \"Of course Miami is a beautiful place, a lot of nice people around -- a lot of bodies ... it's a nice place to hang out to have some fun.\"\n",
      "While Spanish is still the most popular second language in most South Florida businesses, these days it's becoming more common to hear, \"Obrigada e volte sempre!\" -- Portuguese for \" Thank you, come again!\"\n",
